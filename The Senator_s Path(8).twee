As Captain Typho ushers you into the building and makes sure the way to your quarters is clear. You start to change out of the flight suit, pulling out your com to scroll through the contacts as you do.

Palpatine was the senator for Naboo before he became the Chancellor. An attack on you is an attack on his home.

You tell R2 to push past the secretaries and com trees as you strip off the flight suit and choose an outfit that is suitable for the senate. No time for your makeup. Barely enough time to pull your hair back. Then R2 beeps and you hear the quiet rumble of the senate dome behind the answering voice.

"Padme? My dear, what has happened? I'm afraid I'm in the middle of a session at the moment--"

"Apologies. My ship was just attacked. Bombed." You push through the lump in your throat and the image of Corde that paints itself behind your eyes. "I must speak with you about this threat."

Palpatine hums. "I see yes. Go to my office. It's safe there. I was about to call an end to today's session in any case. Be safe." And the com goes silent. 

You let out a breath. Grief and rage and guilt try to push over your thoughts. No time to grieve. You have a job to do.

As Captain Typho ushers you into the building and makes sure the way to your quarters is clear. You start to change out of the flight suit, pulling out your com to scroll through the contacts as you do. One name jumps out at you

Bail Organa

He has been a friend and mentor since you became a Senator rather then a Queen. You can trust him. You're sure of it. You open a text channel.
(set:$bail to it+1)(if:$show is true)[
`{Bail Organa approves}
`]
(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[  My convoy was attacked. ]

You don't know what else to say. What can you trust to the wires and signals and how much can you afford to let out the storm of emotions in your chest before it all comes crashing down.

(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[  Padme ]
His answer comes within moments. 
(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[  Are you alright? ]

(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[  Corde is dead. ] 
You answer, and there is so much in those three little words. 

(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[ I'm sorry. Where are you? ] 
then before she can answer. 
(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[ No don't say. I know your security is handling it. Word of this will spread fast. ]

You know that that's the truth. One of the senator in those pods may very well be the person who orchestrated this attack. An attack not just on you, but on the motion you are fighting. The Separatist Faction. The Army of the Republic. This conflict should never have grown to this scale. It goes against everything you believe the Republic stands for.  

(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[  The Chancellor is calling an end to the session for the day. He was talking to an Aid. I think he heard about your incident. ] Bail sends. 

You consider your options.

:: 1-2-2 your quarters {"position":"475,600","size":"100,100"}
The rooms set aside for the Naboo Senator are not failure, not like your home planet. They are not dusty and stale. Aids and guests have used them in the past months and they have been prepared for your arrival. Still when you survey the rooms the knot in your chest holds tight. 

Captain Typho goes over security. R2 plugs into the network. 

You let yourself sink onto a chair and look at the problems in front of you. 

This was an attack on you not Corde, but her death remains and she deserves justice. -- You could ask R2 to find out who is taking the remains of your ship, and where. It may be important for the investigation.

You have studied the current conflict. The separatists haven't been allowed to leave because there is too much profit tied up in the industries between the outer rim and the core. The proposal to create an army to quell the conflict is at best a short term solution and at worst the first step towards losing the republic altogether. 

Bail messages you. "I'm meeting with the Chancellor and the Jedi. They are sending a pair of Jedi to assist with your protection."

You acknowledge and thank him. It will take a bit of time before the Jedi arrive and the unspoken order from both Typho and the Chancellor was to stay put. Still, that does not mean you have to sit idle.

What should you do until the Jedi arrive?

You work with R2 to track the work orders. The ship has been moved to a hanger where it will be investigated. There are already bids coming in for salvage. It doesn't seem to be a priority. Is that because you survived or because someone wants to keep this quiet? You don't know yet. Further investigation is needed.

As much as you are hurting you need to keep sight of the bigger picture. You reach out to your staff and start shaping the narrative. This was the act of someone who was hurt and desperate. The fact that we have gotten to this point is a tragedy.  This attack was highly visible and close to home. People are paying attention now, and yours is the voice they will hear.

"What makes you say that?" Your tone is a bit sharper then it should be but as you drop your eyes he seems to soften. He steps forward, waiting until you lift your eyes again.

"You have made your voice heard Senator. The Jedi pay attention to people like you."

You meet his eyes, and though your voice is low and respectful, you don't hold back when choosing your words. "If you've truly been paying attention then you should be aware that the Miners union reached an agreement just before I left. I expect this current threat comes from somewhere closer to your home then to mine."

Master Windu lifts an eyebrow. "It's possible. As we were just saying. These are dark times. Nothing is certain.

"In grave danger you are," Master Yoda added, tapping his stick for emphasis. 

By the window, the chancellor turned and folded his hands in front of him. "Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator beplaced under the protection of your graces."

You look at master Windu again. He's considering it. You wonder what they know. The Jedi are not your enemy, but they hold as much power as the senate in their own way, and there aren't the restrictions on them that are on you. 

"Is there someone you would recommend, Master Windu?" you ask. You don't need any more guards, but you do need more allies, and keeping open the lines of communication can't be a bad thing. 

"Perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi..." Chancellor Palpatine offers. 

Mace takes a minute to consider the matter before nodding. "He and Padawan Skywalker have recently returned from Ansion. I'll have him report to you." You eyes meet again and there's something of that tension that lingers, a coiled spring winding slowly tighter. Has he noticed it too? It's hard to tell, but it does seem like he bows a little deeper to you before he leaves the room. 

You center yourself. Who should you speak to?

"I think that Count Dooku was behind it." You could list out your reasons but it's clear from their faces that the idea had never crossed their minds. After all he's only an outspoken poletition who is known for critisizing basically everything about the republic. 

(set:$mace to it-1)(if:$show is true)[`{Mace Windu disapproves}`]

"He is a political idealist, not a murderer." Ki Adi Mundi says as if the two are mutualy exclusive. 

"You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He couldn't assassinate anyone. It's not in his character." Master Windu is wearing a small condisending smile. It calls up the same urge you had as a child, the urge to prove yourself, to prove him wrong. 

Yoda speaks before you can form a properly formed rebuttle.

"In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains for certain, Senator, in grave danger you are."

"Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces."

You didn't notice when Chancellor Palpatine moved to the window, but he's standing there now. You know he's quite aware of the picture it paints, the light and the city behind him, fraiming him. He put himself there, instead of coming to her, taking her hands or meeting her at her level.

"Do you think that is a wise decision during these stressful times?"

You step in before anyone else can speak for you.

"This situation is serious, Senator you have already nearly avoided death once." He held up a hand when you took a breath to protest. "I realize all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi." 

Master Windu and Chancellor Palpatine nod to each other.

"That's possible. He has just returned from a border dispute on Ansion," Windu says.

"This is not necessary, Chancellor," you protest, but it's clear they've already made up their minds. 

"Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable."

You let out a breath. He's right. Maybe it's for the best. You barely hear Master Windu tell you he will have Obi-Wan report to you. Then people are standing, moving. It's your last chance to speak with them privately.

"Perhapse I should just move my things into the temple," you say. The ripple of subtle shock and disaproval gives you the opening to continue. "Chancellor, Masters, I aprechiate your concern for my safety, but having a jedi dog my steps will polorize anyone I may speak to. Many of the Sepratists see the Jedi as child stealers. Others see them as pawns of the Senate. I've seen more then one Proposal for the Grand Army of the Republic that has Jedi acting as Generals - which has been outlawed since the Ruson Reformation. If the Jedi are looming over my shoulder, It will overshadow everything I do." 
(set:$bail to it+1)
(if:$show is true)[`{Bail Organa approves}`]

"Senator Amidala is correct Chancellor," Bail said, stepping up to stand at your shoulder. "Perhapse some of the Senate guard?"

Chancellor Palpatine touches his lips, his eyes distant. There's concern in his features, but concern for your safety or the future of the Republic, you can't say.

"There are Jedi who are used to working quietly Senator." <!-- Hook for Quinlan-->

The Chancellor's eyes clear. "True. And they do not need to be with you in the Senate. Please I would be heartbroken. The thought of losing you would strike a blow to all of Naboo. At least let them look at your security. Perhapse if it was someone you know? Master Kenobi perhapse?"

You let out a breath. He's right. Maybe it's for the best. You barely hear Master Windu tell you he will have Obi-Wan report to you. Then people are standing, moving. It's your last chance to speak with them privately.

You, Captain Typho and Dorme make your way back to the apartment reserved for you. You've been there before but not for some time. Your bags have been brought here ahead of you. 

You shed some of the trappings of your station. You take a bit to eat something, drink a glass of water. 

Your mind swims through the events of the day, all you don't know, all your hopes, and the obsticals in front of you. You have only taken the first step, with so much ahead of you.

<!--Go with Quinlan-->
Quinlan takes you down to the shuttle station, where you catch one train, and then a second. You go down fourty levels and finally enter a building that seems to house various offices and remote operations. They office he guides you to seems to be mostly used for storage. The door doesn't want to open at first and then everything inside, crates and long term freeze units are coated in a layer of dust. When the door is locked between you and the outside world he turns to you.

"What do you know about bounty hunting?"

You shrug. "Not much. I'm guessing that it was a bounty hunter who attacked me, but I don't have proof."

"Yeah, well, between me and Obi-Wan we have the proof, but not much more then that. Obi-Wan is going to follow the trail from his end - the person who hired the hit. we are going to work it from the other end. I've got a bounty permit, and there's a meeting hall not far from here, but getting you in..."

"I don't exactly look the part." In your handmaiden garb you look as unimposing and bland as possible. "Unless, could we say I blend in? Take people unawares?"

"It's a good idea, but in this case your face needs to be hidden. They'll have fachal recognition. This isn't the first person that someone has come after the guild for one reason or another. Just because we want information rather then blood won't matter much." He hesitates and you can see him weighing his next words. (if:$ch3 is "jedi")["The hunter that you and Obi-Wan aprihended last night. Would you be comfortable impersonating them?"](else:)[Last night. The hunter who attacked you, I was able to pick up their trail. Someone killed them early this mourning. Would you be comfortable taking their place?]

You rock back on your heals. "I-- Wouldn't a scan prove I'm not them?"

"Zam was a chamelion, able to change their bio-signiture. I have their armor. That should have all the access codes and ident data, it's more a question of if you think you can pull it off."

You take a breath and think it through. You've swaped places with your handmaidens penty of times, but this is different. You don't know Zam's habits, or friends. Anything you might say could tip them off.

"If you're not 100% you can stay here and run coms for me." Quinlan says. 

It's a way out, but is it one you want to take?

"I can do it. I'll act the part." You shove any fear and doubt down where you can't hear it. 

Quinlan watches you for another minute before nodding. "Alright." He leads you past the first layer of boxes and into a new space. It's much cleaner, no dust to be seen. There's also a box the size of a footlocker sitting on a desk.

"That's her armor, there's a bathroom over there." He nods and turns away, stripping off his jacket and pulling out a long synth-leather duster from a locker. 

The box is heavier then it looks. And even if it's been cleaned the smell of sweat and oil has permiated every part of it. You know someone died in this armor only hours ago but you push that knowledge down with your fear, focusing on the slow methodical tasks of tieing up your hair, drawing on the layers one by one, tuning the HUD and the gauntlets to work for you. If R2 was here it would have taken seconds but he's off with Dorme and Anakin, so you make due. 

Looking at yourself in the mirror over the sink, you don't look like yourself. That's probably a good thing. You streighten, trying to putyourself in the mind of the bounty hunter, hungry, compitence matched and tempered by desperation. 

You don't say a word as you exit the bathroom. Quinlan has made his own transformation, pulling his dreadlocks back in a high tail, an armored colar protecting his neck, framed by the long jacket. He's still wearing gloves and a detox mask hangs from a strap around his neck. It takes you a moment to realize what's missing, The gold stripe across his nose has been masked.

He looks you over. "Ready?"

You nod. You're as ready as you're going to get. 

Quinlan instructs you to call him Quill. He has an unmarked speeder. You spend the travel time quizzing on what to say if anyone asks you what happened. It's one of the few things you can do to prepair. 

(if:$ch3 is "jedi")[The story is that you were captured, but legally the Jedi didn't have anything on you. You spent twelve house in a holding cell before suddenly being released. You're assuming they're watching you somehow so you called a friend - Quill - for a ride and plan to hole up in the guild house for a few days.](else:)[The story is that the Jedi were hunting you. You managed to hide out in the lower levels but they know enough that you need a defensible place to stay for a day or two. Once you were sure the Jedi had left you called an assosiate - Quill - who agreed to give you a ride. ]

"One last thing," Quinlan says as you're getting close. One of us will have to cause a distraction while the other goes in for the data." He offered a micro-drave. "One for me, one for you. It's got a set of keywords and an algorythom that can hack through nearly anything but only if it's plugged directly into the network."

You nod and tuck the drive into your belt. There's no knowing if it'll have to be you or him. If someone will recognise one of you, if your disguise will be good enough, if, if, if...

You arrive and park the speeder in an attached garage. The lift  takes you into a private world. 

The Bounty Hunters guild is a licenced buisiness and is allowed to opperate in the republic. That said they generally aren't welcomed into polite scociety. Their home bace reflects that. before even entering you and Quill have to pass through a scanner, and slide a pair of licences through a reader. The droid reluctantly lets you through.

Inside there's a counter with advertisements for barely legal weapon mods. There's a board flickering with open bounties, and a counter with a short Gamorian managing offichial buisiness. There's a row of vending machienes, and a low-credit snack counter. There's a lift guarded by a security droid. There are a row of holo-stations along one wall. The administrative offices are tucked behind a door in one corner. There's an ident scanner, and proabby a few more security measures you can't see. 

You and Quill get a few looks but it seems like you're both recognised enough that no one gets up to pick a fight. So far so good.

You dip your head. "This is important. It's too much of a risk to try to go in there with a bounty on my head. I'll run coms for you."

Quinlan nods. "Okay, I've got a set-up over there. Get failure with it while I change."

You find the desk with an audio-visual setup and toggle through the various options. The cameras have to be simple to stay undetected which mean they could get cut off. You set them to record if that happens. The microphones are using an extreemly low frequency, which means there might be a delay but they'll go through nearly anything, including all the buildings between you and the target, and any jammers in thouse buildings. They also can jump onto the Jedi network at any point which is as good as a military or government channel. Of course if you do that, there wil be no hiding it...

When Quinlan returns he's made his own transformation, pulling his dreadlocks back in a high tail, an armored colar protecting his neck, framed by the long jacket. He's still wearing gloves and a detox mask hangs from a strap around his neck. It takes you a moment to realize what's missing, The gold stripe across his nose has been masked.

You help him attach a camera to the colar, another to his belt. A mic goes into his his glove, the detox-mask and again, the colar. 

"Wish me luck," he says with a wink, before sauntering out the door.

You settle in, tracking his location until finally the speeder he's in comes to a stop and the background noise drops to a low hum. You hold your breath as he goes through a scanner, but nothing goes off. Then he swipes an ident chip and he's in. 

Inside there's a counter with advertisements for barely legal weapon mods. There's a board flickering with open bounties, and a counter with a short Gamorian managing offichial buisiness. There's a row of vending machienes, and a low-credit snack counter. There's a lift guarded by a security droid. There are a row of holo-stations along one wall. The administrative offices are tucked behind a door in one corner. There's an ident scanner, and proably a few more security measures you can't see. 

You might be able to skim the security and let him through the door but it's still early to show your hand, plus, he hasn't actually asked for your help...

Obi-Wan is as casual you please as you slip through the temple. He greats other masters and smiles at Padawans and generally takes any attention off you so subtly that no one notices he's doing it. 

When you reach the library he nods to the guard and motions for you to precede him. Just like that you find yourself in the stacks of one of the largest and most comprehensive libraries in the galaxy. 

"Planetary data will be on the fourth level." Obi-Wan says indicating the right path with a casual wave of his hand. 

The planetary section is calm and quiet, excusing the occasional padawan running messages. Kamino is close to the Risshi maze so that's where you start. Census data, orbital data, starshift, and reflected signals. You gather all of it, reserving a station to compile what you've found. You're able to exclude whole sections where the local stars are unstable or have had violent flares in the last ten years. You remove another section from the ist when you Obi-Wan descovers a wash of radiation that came out of the maze two years ago. 

Three hours later and you know where the planet should be, except it isn't. 

You sit back in your seat and rub your eyes. "What are we missing?"

"I don't know," Obi-Wan says. He;s stroking his beard again. He's been doing that more and more over the last hour. "The gravitational data is there. This system should have 5 planets. but only four have been recorded."

"Okay, can we rule it out somehow. Could this be old data? Could the planet have been destroyed?" You sit forward, naturally falling into debate mode. 

"Possible but highly unlikely. The kind of thing that coud take out a whole planet is not likely to leave the rest of the system untouched. The orbits of the other planets would fluxuate at the very least."

"So old data," you point at him.

He spends a moment checking then shakes his head. "If this was data from before a planet was somehow created then the signitres would would be a standard elipse, no gap. And this data isn't that old. It was gathered by a servey team 19 months ago. Dex reported that Kamino has been active for decades even if that activity is quiet."

"Some kind of dwarf planet? Small but dense?"

That makes him pause. "Possible. Not likely for standard human variants but possible. Pull up that redshift spectrum analysis."

You shuffle through the disks you've collected until you find the right file and send it over. Obi-Wan spends a moment focusing the overlay so everything matches up. then he shakes his head. "No sign of a dwarf planet, and before you ask, all the other planets in the system seem to be the expected mass. We still have a planitary body unaccounted for." 

You shake your head. "So it's a mistake and we're looking in the wrong direction or there's something there and we're looking right at it and still can't see it."

Obi-Wan sighs. "That seems to be about the shape of it."

"So. We could go out there, or rather send someone out there if there's anyone in the area you can tap. Or we can find another source."

"There are older records in the archives, they are generally restricted and not often accessed due to it being older data but it could be worth a shot. Or we could send a message to the exploration core, but... I'm afraid either way we are likely to draw attantion." 

Meaning you wont get a second chance at this.

Anakin. Of course, he was Obi-Wan's Padawan. Of course he would accompony him on the mission. You don't know why it came as such a surprise. 

You need a moment to put the past in perspective. Better to focus on why they are here, rather then the force of their presence in the room. 

Maybe Obi-Wan can sense your intentions becasue he steps in to fill the gap. "Our presence will be invisible, M'Lady, I can assure you."

They move to sit, Captain Typho coming to stand over your chair. "I'm very grateful you're here, Master Kenobi. I'm Captain Typho, head of Her Majesty's security service.  The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit."

You frown. This seems to have become the theme since you've arrived.

"Thank you. I know this is very sudden. From what I understand you just finished another mission, to Ansion? I hope I'm not dragging you away from some well deserved rest."

"Not at all." Obi-Wan says, stepping forward. "We're close enough to home to sleep in our own beds and you'll be the one tending to all the tedious meetings. We are glad to help."

"I could tell you about it, Ansion, if you're interested." Anakin was almost eager.

"I'd like that," you pause, "As long as you wouldn'tget into trouble for it. I know some Jedi missions are confidential..." You trail off looking between them.

"Perhapse not Ansion, but I'm sure there are other stories Anakin could tell you," Obi-Wan pats Anakin on the shoulder before turning back to the group at large and taking on a serious posture. "But first we should see to your safety." He motions towards the sitting area.

You spread your skirts around you as you refocus on the what needs to happen next.

Anakin opens his mouth in surprise, eyes wide and dark. For a moment you think you broke him. He's just standing there. Then he has his arms around you and he's pressing his mouth to yours. His kisses are unpracticed but eager enough to make up for it. 

When he leans back gulping in air his eyes are dark and you can feel the hard line of him all down your front. 

"Is this? Are you sure?"

"I-" you bite your lip. "Yes, and no." 

Suddenly there's tension in his shoulders, his hands turn stiff on your arms. He swallows. "What... what do you mean?"

You let him hold a bit of your weight, as you look up at him through your lashes. "It would make things easier in a way. Let me let go of the day. I do like you. I just... There's the trap and Obi-Wan will come back at some point. Are you even allowed to? As a Jedi?

You tense as he relaxes, a smile transforming his features. If he wasn't allowed it would be a loss to eveyone interested in the human masculan form. 

"Jedi can have sex. We're people not just ideals." Then he sighs and looks back towards the door. "But you're right that Obi-Wan will be back soon. It's probably not..." He shrugs. 

You slowly pull away from him. You can still taste him on your lips. It's not going to be easy to fall asleep at this point. 

"Maybe when this is all over we can revisit this."

"I think I'd ike that." He says and his voice is lower then it was, rough and hungry.

Getting to sleep really will be impossible, but you'll have to try.

You sigh. "You're right. It's a silly idea. I just..."

"You're not the kind of person to sit around. I learned that the first time you pushed your way into that junk shop." He reaches up, and brushes a strand of hair away from your face. "I know it's not easy to let others tke al the risks, but will you trust me? I promice, you are the most important thing in the world to me. I will keep you safe, whatever it takes."

You lean into his hand, and let your eyes flutter closed briefly. "You'll be there? If anything happens?"

"I swear." His voice is so much lower then you remember. Steadier. When you open your eyes you can see the boy he was, but it's layered over with the man he's becoming. 

"Thank you Ani."

He nods, steps back and bows. "I'll let you sleep." 

He closes the door behind him, leaving you and R2 alone in the room.

"Shall I lay out your clothes for tomorrow my lady?" Dorme asks. She has that look in her eye, the look of a shared secret. Even R2 has slipped away. If she leaves it will be just you and Anakin. 

You can feel a bit of color rise in your cheeks as you nod. "Yes, thank you."

You and Anakin stand in an a circle of false casualness until the click of the door signals you are alone.

Anakin is looking at you. His eyes scan every facit of you, from the way your hair has been twisted and pinned up to the soft slippers just visible under the hem of your gown. He's a full arms length from you. He'd have to step forward to touch you, but that doesn't stop you from feeling like he's surounding you.

"I didn't know if I'd ever see you again." His voice is low, just above a whisper. "I've thought about you every day. Sometimes, when the other Jedi didn't understand, I'd think about what might have happened if Obi-Wan hadn't taken me as his Padawan. If I'd stayed on Naboo..." 

He takes a shaky breath and looks away, towards the window. The tension in the air fades away. You turn, half watching him while facing the window and the city beyond. 

"I thought about you too. Whenever I heard news of the Jedi I'd wonder if it was actually you and Obi-Wan. There's so many stories, and so many of them are exaggerated or biased, but it was nice to think that someone I knew and trusted was out there, helping and protecting people. Sometimes, when all the politics got to be too much, I'd fantasize about you coming in and destroying all the flimsywork with a lightsaber. Although I didn't really know what you looked like after you left so..." You duck your head and laugh a little, self-deprecating.

"Master Obi-Wan would say that that was an inappropriate use of the force, but I'd do it anyway, for you." His smile is back as he leans sideways, brushing your shoulders together.

"Don't tempt me. This next week is going to be nothing but flimsywork." You groan and let your shoulders slump a bit. 

"At least you wont be facing it alone." He steps in hand drawing up your arm until he's cupping your cheek. He's looking at you again. It's overwhelming. Like you're water in the desert, food to the starving, like you're as important as the air that's keeping you both alive.

[[Step Back->2-13-1]]

You're blushing as you step back, ducking a little. The hairs on your arms are standing upright. His presence or aura is overwhelming. You just need a moment. When you look up again there's concern on his face.

"It's been a long day." You say and he begins to close in on himself, nodding and glancing towards the window. You catch his hand as it falls. "But you'll be here tomorrow?"

He looks at your hands as you lace your fingers between his This time his smile is softer, steadier. You feel like you're being lifted by a wave rather then engulfed by the water.

"Of course," He raises your laced hands and places a kiss on your knuckles. "Good night Padme."

[[Go to bed->2-5-1]]


:: 2-13-2 {"position":"1250,1325","size":"100,100"}
You stretch up on your tows as he bends, meeting in the middle for a lingering kiss. The lights from outside play across his face, changing the collar of his eyes. You could get drunk on this man. If you gave yourself to him...

"Padme," he whispers, tugging you in, slowly moving across your jaw towards your neck. The couch is right there. You could just lay back and offer yourself. The way he's acting he'd probably worship you...

"Are you-- You won't get into trouble?" You ask. Then he finds a spot that makes you shiver and you barely hear the answer.

"I'll get a hell of a lecture if Obi-Wan finds out, but he always flirts with the people we're assigned to. It's my turn." The last bit comes out low, not a growl, but something that could grow into one.

You stumble back to lean againt the couch. You can't believe you're doing this, letting him kiss you, press his hands down along your sides, starting to explore. You haven't seen Anakin in years but it feels so good.

A Shrill little beep has both of you pulling back, gasping and looking towards the door. R2 swives his dome and beeps a few more times. Anakin streightens, and steps back. He blinks, eyes unfocused for a moment.

"Obi-Wan's in the lift." He glances at you, and there's color in his cheeks. He has to shift his robes to hide the hard length between his legs. 

You nod, and spend a moment putting yourself to rights. You glance at the lift. "I should go to bed." There's a touch of regret in those words, but Anakin still nods. You meet his eyes one last time. The intensity of it makes you want to throw away propriety and pull him down onto the couch. Instead you force yourself to turn and retreat into your rooms.

You find Dorme's hand and squeeze it. She squeezes back. 

"I trust you," you say again. "Maybe... if I asked for help, for someone, a friend, to be there for me... Having you be that person - I think I might actually be able to face some of it."

"Oh, Padme," the words come out on a breath. He rose and stepped around the low table, dropping to one knee. He cups your free hand between both of his. His eyes are a clear pale blue, like the water in the lake country.

"I am truely honored. Whatever I can do to earn that trust, simply ask."

Obi-Wan raises an eyebrow, the edge of a smile lifting his lips. "You'll forgive me if I don't trust the intentions of a carear poletition."

You tip your head and widen your eyes a bit. "My dear Jedi, That description would apply to me as well. Are you saying you don't trust me? And when you are here to protect me?" You bring a hand to your chest in a show of surprise.

"Ah but you are a beautiful young woman. How could I not extend a mesure of trust. I may not know the Chancellor personally but anyone would be mad to want to spend time with that old man over your wit and charm." The quiet smile is there in full. He leans forward in his seat. He might even be enjoying the exchange.

"Such flatery. You do know that you didn't actually answer the question? The tallent you hae with words, you would make a fine poletition yourself."

Obi-Wan brings a hand to his chest. "Padme you wound me. I would never! Besides poletics would be too much for me to handle, with the threats and assasination attempts. I don't have anywhere near your fortitude."

The reminder of what the day has held settles on your shoulders. You dip your head, before meeting his eyes again. "Enough for one day, but if I don't retire soon, tomorrow might be in question."

He stands, offering you a hand to help you rise. You're close enough that you can feel his robe brush against you. The banter has you feeling playfull.

"Tell me about yourself? What have you been doing these past few years."

Obi-Wan leans back, crossing his legs and stroking his beard with one hand. "I was knighted on Naboo. Things changed a lot after that." His expression turns distant, then he draws himself back to the present. "most recently I returned from Ansion. There was a border dispute. There's a wondering micro-planet in the system and it's irregular orbit brought it into the Namadii system at the far edge."

Padme nodded. "Let me guess. no one cared until something valuable was discovered there?"

Obi-Wan nodded, "And then the taxation rights came into question and the local buisiness owners were trying to rush things so the workers were being treated terribly. It was the next best thing to slave labor."

"Terrible."

He nodded, "Yes, and all too common."

You share a look, determination, frustration, and quiet anger. 

"Did they say they wanted you there and then act outraged when you didn't agree with everything they said?"

"Force, yes. And then they try to threaten and bribe. Honestly, I'm a jedi. Has our reputation dropped that far? I know we're stretched thin, but you'd think they'd do a bit of reserch when we were called in."

You nod. "And then they act like todlers when someone tells them no. Honestly, I was elected at fourteen and even then I wasn't as imature as half the people I have to deal with on a regular basis."

Obi-Wan was leaning in, nodding, "And the little things. I'm sorry we can't import a highly expensive delicasy from your home planet, never mind that it would be toxic to everyone else. What was that? The light in your room isn't natural enough for you? I'm sorry this planet is in it's winter at the moment, I'll get right on that."

"Because of course it's your duty to oversee it personally."

You share a look and both of you break into soft laugter. It's releaf more then anything else. You didn't expect this. It's nice. You relax back into your seat and a yawn surprises you.

You hesitate, glancing down at your clasped hands. Obi-Wan tilts his head, humming in question. 

"You're here because there will be another attack."

His expression turns soft. "Until we know for certain who attacked you and why, yes you are in danger, but we will be here to--"

You lift a hand cutting him off. "I am not a passive person. I don't like waiting for someone else to act."

Obi-Wan nods.

"Since we know I am the target, our smartest option is to set a trap for them." His expression turns sceptical. You can tell he's not keen on the idea.

You retreat into your rooms, stairing at the bed for a minute while Dorme takse your robe and lais out sleap clothes.

He takes a breath. You speak before he can find the words to remind you of propriety or duty.

"I've enjoyed this. Thank you for staying with me this evening."

You put a little bit of space between you, and ignore the knowing look from Dorme.

You put one finger to your lips, considering. "One of my advisors once asked why castles had large doors. Do you know why?"

Obi-Wan sceptical expression turns to one of mild interest. "I admit I've never spent much time on archetecture. I supose you can enlighten me?"

"Castles are a holdover from a previous age. They are fortifications. Putting a large opening in your fortifications sounds contrary until you look at things from another perspective. It's a designated weak point. That's where the enemy will attack, and so the defenders will know where to focus their guards, rather than spread them thin over everything."

"And you are proposing that we give your attackers such a weak spot."

You stand and brush down your skirts. "Well it can't be too obvious, but a small opening, a weakness in the balcony's shields or maybe the window. Then we can reasonably assume that they'll come from that direction rather then, say, from the lift."

He settles back on his heels looking around the room. He's stroking his beard and you can tell he's analyzing everything over again. 

"It could work. Not the bacony. Anakin and I will be expected to stay here in your outer rooms. I think something in your chambers could be arranged." He pauses and turns back to you. "Are you sure about this. If you have even a thread of doubt..."

You take his hand and squeeze it. "I trust you. I know you'll be here. You'll sense it as soon as anyone comes close."

His posture shifts, and he nods slowly. "Then let us set a trap."

And I'm not sure that would work given that they know to look for it now... No, opening a hole in your security is asking for trouble. Our mandate is to protect you, and I can't do that if you put yourself in front of a blaster."

Your shoulders slump a bit. You'll still be doing things, but knowing that an unknown enemy is out there, and there's nothing you can do...

Obi-Wan puts a hand on your shoulder. "I know it's hard, but if something were to happen..." His words trail off. He meets your eyes for a long moment, then looks away. There's something there, under the surface, but you don't know him well enough yet, to read it.

Both Jedi fell silent. Obi-Wan's expression shifted between concern and determination. Anakin's expresion had the start of a smile, a touch of hope or awe.

You stand, fighting the urge to smooth down your skirt. 

"I will thank you for any help you can and choose to provide. But I think... that is a matter for the morning." You turn to Captain Typho. "I trust you will give these honored friends access to whatever they might need." (if:$ship is true)[And until your contacts get back to you about the ship there's not much you can do. ](if:$senate is true)[And you need to know what your contacts in the senate have learned. ]

Anakin and Obi-Wan stand and bow as Dorme stepped up beside you. 

You turn and take a step towards your private quarters, then hesitate, glancing over your shoulder.

You hesitate. Anakin's expression says there's more to this argument. Something between him and Obi-Wan. 

Obi-Wan's words are sharper then you've yet heard. "We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner!"

"I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course." 

"We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin. And you will pay attention to my lead." Obi-Wan has turned in his seat, fixing Anakin with that steel blue gaze.

You glance down at your hands. You've been in the political sphere long enough that you almost never see a true argument.  Fights are either the political shouting matches put on for whatever audience might be around or they are kept behind closed doors so no one can use it against you. You don't really know how to react or who is in the right.

"Why?" Anakin asks and you wince. 

"What?" Obi-Wan's accent is slightly stronger, like he's bitten off the word. 

"Why else do you think we were assigned to protect her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate."

"We will do exactly as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one." 

You sit with your spine streight and keep your voice low and even as you speak. "Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now, if you will excuse me, I will retire." You stand and move to retreat further into your rooms. Anakin and Obi-Wan stand and bow as Dorme stepped up beside you.

"The Chancellor had information? I wasn't aware he had the time to look into it."

The two Jedi pause. Anakin drops his gaze and everyone in the room can probably tell that he's trying to pull his foot out of his mouth. 

Obi-Wan relaxes a fraction. "Yes, well, I admit there wasn't much to the file. At least reguarding the attack earlier today. However his office does employ a number of analysts, and apparently they already had a file on you."
(set:$danger to it+1)
"I supose that makes sense given that we are both from Naboo, and attack on me could be seen as a threat to him..." You pinch your lips. It doesn't feel right. "Was there anything illuminating in that file?"

"It mostly concerned your security on Naboo with a few notes on your personel." Obi-Wan nods to Captain Typho and then to Dorme. 

"I'll be glad to show you our setup both for the building and for when she's traveling to the senate." Captain Typho says. 

"Shouldn't one of us stay with her?" Anakin glancees at Obi-Wan. "If something does get through we're here as a last line of defense."

Obi-Wan nods. "Good thinking padawan."

You let the door to your rooms close between you. Dorme helps you take down your hair, and undoes the hook of your dress at the back of your neck. It's routine, and in that way comforting.

After a time she wishes you goodnight and slips away leaving you alone. 

You spend a minute, standing by the window. The city was beautiful in it's way but it was so diferent from the greens of Naboo. The rushing of water was replaced by the thrum of traffic and the humm of electricity. 

You take a breath and breath it out against the glass, fogging it slightly. You focus for a minute on the iron bar that your shouders have become, trying to ease the tension. 

Eventually you turn back to the room. It's not what you're used to but it will do. Your com sits on the bedside table. You consider it for a moment.

Mace Windu.

(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[ Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker have been assigned to you. You may contact me and the council if you run into any more trouble or require further resources. ] 

You bite your lip. A part of you reiterates that this is not nessisary. You and your team are perfectly capable. Then the thought fades. Mace didn't have to Com you. This might be a formality but it might be an outstretched hand. 

You consider what to say before replying  

(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[ Thank you. I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances. If there's anything I can do for you, please let me know. ]

There's a short pause before his message comes through. 

(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[ There are shatter points all around you. You are in a position to change the galaxy. If I'm honest, I'm interested to see what you'll create. ]

Your breath catches just sightly. You want him to keep going. You almost wish that the coms were more then text. How would those words sound? What tone would he use? When you don't respond another message pops up.

(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[ May the Force be with you Padme. Good night. ] 

And the connection closed.You fall back onto the bed, and let your com fall onto your chest. The jump-lag has caught up with you. That has to be the reason for the way your skin is tingling. You stare at the ceiling and think about what he said, about what comes next.

"R2?"

The little droid turns towards you and beeps. You bite your lip, calculating. 

"You're linked in with Captain Typho's security network?" 

A little trill in confirmation. 

"If someone does attack..." 

These attacks aren't going to stop. Either you catch the attacker, and nullify the threat, or this will continue and the people around you wil keep getting hurt, at least until the senate decides things one way or the other. 

Dorme has already departed. 

You have an idea, but she wouldn't like it. Niether would Captain Typho. But Anakin... You may not have spoken to him in years but not that much can have changed.

"Will you call Anakin in here?" you ask R2. It beeps and rolls off towards the door. A minute later Anakin is silluetted in the doorway, glancing between you and R2.

"Padme?"

"I need your help. You and R2. Will you help me set a trap for the assasins?"

His eyes go wide. Then his eyebrows come down in concern. "Are you sure that's a good idea? I- we are here to keep you safe, not... use you as bait in a trap."

You step forward. Your eyes drop, watching his hands more then his face. Do you have the right to ask this?

"I'll get back to the security office as well. Call if you need anything," Captain Typho added a little bow to the words, and let Jar Jar away, leaving only Obi-Wan, Dorme and yourself. 

Obi-Wan relaxed a fraction. He stroked his beard with one hand. "I admit I'm a bit surprised. Flatered truely, Your company is far prefrable to the other tasks I could be doing at the moment, but may I ask why you would prefer my company over Anakins, or someone elses?"

You smile, just a little. "I wont. nothing wi happen because as soon as they step into the trap you'll be right here to take them down."

Your words get an answering smile from him. "Alright, how do you want to set it up?"

R2 beeps, and points one of it's claws at the window. 

Anakin humms in thought, nodding slightly. "Yeah, could work, but we can't make it too obvious."

You are utterly unsurprised that Anakin can understand Binary. You can understand R2 most of the time but it's a verry expressive droid. 

It takes maybe twenty minutes, but you work out something that looks like a chink in the security. R2 beeps when it's done with the adjustments to the window's shielding.

Anakin nods. "Okay great. You get some rest. I'll be right outside." He squeezes your hand. You squeeze back. Your heart is fluttering and you're not sure if it's from the situation or Anakin's proximity. 

He stands, leaving you sitting on the bed. He's so much taller then you remember. The line of his padawan braid draws your eye down the line of his neck to the V of his robes.

"As you wish Senator." Anakin has never sounded so formal, so lacking in emotion. He bows, and steps back, moving to stand in a corner of the room, out of the way. Everything in his posture screems that he is not a participant. He might almost not exist. 

You shiver. It doesn't feel right, but this is the choice you've made. 

"R2, the window has to be the weakest point of defence for this room, correct?" You ask.

The droid turns it's camera from Anakin to you and back again before beeping something you're fairly sure is agreement. 

You work out something that you hope wont look too obvious. Every so often your eyes drift to Anakin, standing sentinal and the little puddle of guilt in your gut grows slightly. 

"Thank you R2. Please keep watch through the night." you say when everything is in place.

"Will that be all you need from me Senator?" Anakin asks, breaking his silence for the first time. 

You duck your head, and tuck a bit of hair behind one ear. "Yes. Thank you."

He turns and moves stiffly towards the door.

"Anakin?"

He pauses and looks over one shoulder. You don't really know what to say, except that it feels terrible to see him like this.

"Good night," is all you manage, but a fraction of the tension eases from his shoulders.

You lean into his hand, and let your eyes flutter closed briefly. "You'll be there? If anything happens?"

"I swear." His voice is so much lower then you remember. Steadier. When you open your eyes you can see the boy he was, but it's layered over with the man he's becoming. There's devotion and trust and maybe even love in his eyes. No one has looked at you like that. Maybe they've looked at Amidalla like that; the mask you wear with the elegant silks and the hours of makeup, but here in your bedroom, with everything stripped away...

"Thank you Ani."

He leans in just enough to brush your forhead with a kiss before stepping back and falling into a formal Jedi posture.

Dooku's argument was that the structure had become inflexible and I can agree with that. There are races and planets with new needs that couldn't have been imaguined when the senate was set in place. It's the fact that that inflexabuility has led to such conflict that is frustrating to me personally. As the head of the order..." He pauses and studies the paterns in the sand. "Once, the jedi were more widespread. If we had more members, more temples, then things might be diferent, but at this point the only way the jedi survive as a culture is to stick together. In that way we have to support the chancelor."

You let the silence settle, before taking a breath. "So it's war then..."

"Maybe... I would have said so yesterday. Now..." He turns and looks at you. you feel like he's looking into your soul all over again and shiver, arching your back just slightly. 

"Before I met you..." His words slip into the quiet room. "I look forward to what you might acomplish in the next few days."

You nod, your heart fluttering in your chest.

You let out a breath and select the floor for the Naboo offices. As much as you want to talk to Bail, it's too early to wait around his office and yearning. 

The door to the offices open to your palm scan and the lights come up at a wave of your hand. The office shows signs of habitation. There are desks for aids and secrataries, Nubian plants in pots tucked into the corners. 

Your desk, or at least the desk for the senior Naboo senetor, is tucked into a corner office. There are bland pictures on the walls. You've never been here long enough to make an impact on the space. 

You open your console and start sorting messages. There are a wave of recent queries about the attack on your shuttle. You put them in a folder for a secratary to answer. Other older messages take more time. There are requests for your support and questions about how you plan to vote on tedious issues that have little effect on you or your people. 

You blink and come back to yoursef when a chime sounds from the outer office. 

There's no one else here yet. No one to answer the door. Of course, you're not suposed to be open yet...

You hesitate, then select the floor with the Alderaininan offices before you can second guess yourself. 

There's a light on behind the door when you aproach. You can see a pair of silluettes moving back and fourth. A protocal droid answers when you ring the bell. Lights flash in it's optical sensors.

"Senetor Amidalla of Naboo, welcome. Did you have an appointment?"

"Is that Padme, Let her in." Bail's voice drifts in from a back room. 

The droid steps to one side, waving you in. R2 beeps at it as it follows you through the door. The protocal droid tilts it's head and clicks back in Binary. 

"In here," Bail calls. from what seems to be a com room. 

You nod to the only other person in the room - a rather frazzled looking secretary - and poke your head through the door. Bail is sitting on a couch, a holo of his wife Breha next to him. They'd be touching if she was here in person. 

"Padme, welcome, I've been wantng to meet you." Breha says holding out a hand. 

You step forward into the realm of the camera. "Queen Breha? It's a pleasure to finally meet you Bail has told be so much about you." You hold out your hands, then lace them together since you can't actually greet her properly.

"I didn't think you'd take me up on my offer so soon," Bail says. "For once the time difference is actually helpful." He glances at Breha, a little smile touching his lips. 

Breha nods. "Padme, may I ask you a question?" She laces her hands in her lap and leans forward a fraction.

"Of course," you nod. 

"I don't mean this to be..." Breha pauses then starts again. "Chancelor Palpatine was the senetor for Naboo before being elected to his current office, and you were the one to call for a vote of no confidence in Chancelor Velorum..." She glances at Bail. It's hard to tell if she's trying to find the right question or if she just doesn't want to voice whatever it is. 

"Are you asking if I'm willing to go against Chancellor Paplatine in a vote?"

Bail smiles, "Partly, though your actions up to now indicate you would be willing to do so."

You nod, but Breha is still frowning. 

"It's more then that," Breha says. "How well do you actually know the Chancellor?"

You stay still, not saying a word as you watch him over your shouder. He seems human at first, but there's something about him, a variant? He has middle brown skin, spacer's leathers, black gloves. His dreadlocks are tied back away from his face, the yellow stripe across his face draws your eyes, making it hard to pin down anything else. 

Your eyes catch on a tool pack straped to his thigh. There's patch tape there, but there's something else too, and not something you'd expect to see on a mechanic's belt. A length of pipe about six inches long. It might have just been scrap, easilly dismissable, if you hadn't seen something similar earlier this evening. 

A lightsaber.

A Jedi? Or is this a darksider coming to hide their tracks...

You don't have a blaster, or a vibroblade, but you hold up your tablet like it gives you authority. "Who are you? What are your credentials?"

He startles, spinning in a half crouch, clearly expecting an attack. Then he sees you and streightens. The frown is telling. 

"I'm suposed to be here." A little circle of his hand, a preassure, like a weighted blanket on your mind. 

Force tricks. 

You shake your head and push the feeling away. "Identification, or get out."

His eyebrows go up. "And if I said it was jedi buisiness?"

"I would ask what a Jedi has to do with a destroyed Naboo cruser. And also ask you to stop stalling." You purse your lips like a schoolkeeper with a stuborn student. 

"Huh," He runs a hand over his face and when it falls there's a smile, it's charming in a dangerous way. "I'm not stalling, I just didn't recognise one of the senetor's handmaidens. I would ask what a girl like you is doing in a place like this, but I can guess."

You step back as quietly as you can. At one point he pauses and you freeze until the hull of the ship is between you. 

You let out a breath as you step into the hallway. You don't have as much information as you would have liked, but... At least it's something. R2 leads the way back to your speeder. You sag into the seat, glancing at the clock in the dash. The sensible thing to do would be to go back to your rooms, and maybe get another hour of sleep before you have to meet with Bail... Or you could go to the Senate now. Get a jump on things...

You don't have a blaster or a vibro-blade.. Instead you press the edge of your tablet into a the middle of his back.

"Don't move." Your voice is hard, unyelding. 

He stills, you can see the tension in the line of his neck, then suddenly he relaxes, raising his hands slowly.

"I'm no one to be worried about," he says, and for a moment you almost believe it, but you saw the lightsaber, you clear your mind and let the convincing words roll off you.

"I'll be the one to decide that." 

He tilts his head. You get the smallest glimpse of dark brown eyes before he spins. Hand in your face. You pull back. Something hits your leg. Off-balance. he catches your wrist, turns. You start to fall, kick out. He comes down on top of you. 

When you catch your breath, the man in on top of you. You've lost hold of the tablet, that wrist held in an unyealding grip. There's a throbing in your hip that will likely turn into something later. The man is half on top of you. His dreadlocks have come loose, falling around your face, blocking out the rest of the world. The yellow stripe across his nose seems to almost glow, turning his eyes into galaxies. 

"Well, I can't say you're what I expected..." His voice is low, rolling, with a brush of a smile. Then he tips his head. "Aren't you one of the Naboo handmaidens?"

R2 beeps from somewhere over both of you. There's a quiet zapping sound and you know it' from his electro-prod. The man glances up then lifts one hand and eases off you. You almost regret it for a fraction of a second, before you draw yourself back to the moment and your purpose. 

You spend a minute sizing him up as he does the same to you. R2 still has his electro-prod out, clearly just waiting for your word to use it. Instead you bend and retrieve your tablet. 

"That's what you were holding me up with? That takes guts." he smiles, cocky and sure of himself, then he offers a hand. "Want to team up?"

You nod slowly. 

Quinlan takes the lead, sweeping you through the building, to a diferent speeder lot. You'll have to send someone to retrieve your speeder later. 

Traffic is nearly non-existant. The vehical has Jedi codes that clear the way, until the temple is looming above you. You don't go in through the public entrance. Qunlan nods to the temple guard and then you're in the narrower back hallways. They still have a grace and peace to them, but there are signs of life, chips in the corners of masonry, fingerprints on the glass.

You pause as Quinlan makes a call. 

It feels silly to think it but the air is lighter in these halls. Even without your guards, without a blaster hidden up your sleeve and a mask of customs and propriety, you feel safer here then you have in a long time. 
(set:$danger to it-1)
"This way," Quinlan says, leading you down another hall. The door he stops at is simple, and identical to a dozen others on this hallway. "He's expecting you." He holds out a data drive. "The info I found."

Youtake the drive, put yourself together, and let the door slide open. 

The room isn't large, but there's an air of space to it. There's a rock garden in the center.. Rocks and white sand, artfully tended into a spiraling fractal. Cushons set along the walls hint that the space is probably used for meditation. Mace Windu is seeted with his legs crossed under him. His eyes were hal-closed, but he looks up as you enter waving you forward. You nod to R2 to stay in the hall and join the Jedi master. 

[[introduce yourself->3-17-1]]

You shake your head, steping back. This night has already encompased moree then it should be able to hold. Going to the order now, better to just talk to Anakin and Obi-Wan later, let them take things through proper channels. 

R2 is at you side. He beeps, but you're too distracted to try to translate. Hopefuy the droid has what you need.

Quinan tilts his head, then he shrugs and steps back. You circle him, watching sidelong. He lets you leave.

You let out a breath as you step into the hallway. You don't have as much information as you would have liked, but... At least it's something. R2 leads the way back to your speeder.

"I am Senetor Padme Amidalla, it's a pleasure to meet you." You offer your hand. He takes it briefly, waving you to sit beside him.

"Senetor. Interesting. Vos didn't mention that. Though I supose it makes sense. I am Jedi Master Mace Windu. Welcome to the temple. It seems you've been pulled into our tangled web."

"Not for the first time. The blocade, a decade ago." You sit, folding your legs under you.

"True enough. Would you like to tell me what you were doing?"

"I was investigating my ship. After all the explosion killed one of my people."

He tilts his head in concession. "And the Jedi I assigned to protect you?"

"There was another attack earlier tonight. They are investigating. I thought I'd keep myself busy in the mean time."

He lifted an eyebrow. "I see..."

You can feel your cheeks warm. You duck your head and your eyes find the paterns in the sand, following them as you work through what to say.

You stretch and blink away the hint of exhaustion. (set:$monInvitation to true, $monIntroduction to true)

"Be right there," You call. You get a shuffle of movement in response.

There's a slender woman standing just inside the door to your outer office. She had short auburn hair, and is wearing a long white dress with soft purple acccents. She looks vaguely familure but you can't place her.

"Hello, can I help you?"

"Oh, yes. My name is Mon Mothma. I'm the Junior senetor for Chandrilla. I came to drop off an invitation for the Naboo senetor." She has a flimsycard in one hand, not quite fiddling with it. 

"I am senetor Amidalla. I can take it." You smile, trying to put her at ease. Now that she's introduced herself you remember reading a file on her. The senior senetor for Chandrilla has been dealing with some personal matters away from Coruscant for some time. What what you understand Mon Mothma has been using this opertunity to put the weight of her planet behind the peace efforts. 

"You're the senetor?" She smiles and takes you in all over again. "May I say it's a pleasure to meet you." She offers a hand. Her grip is confident without being overwhelming. "I guess I should give you this then. I'm hosting a get together tonight and when I heard that you were on planet I thought, well, I know it's last minute for you but I thought you might be interested. There will only be about fifty people there, senetors and aids and such."

You nod, glancing over the bit of flimsy. "What are your talking points?" You are well aware that there are no casual get togethers, only networking events.

"Well..." She hesitates, bting her lip. You have to wonder what she knows about you.

"My advisors tell me that war is inevitable at this point, so my goal for this evening is to show my support for the Council of Neutral Systems. The Duchess of Mandalor is going to attend, as is Senetor Kin Robb of Taris."

You smile, trying to set her at ease. "That sounds like something I can support. I'll try to be avaliable for it."
(set:$mon to it+1)(if:$show is true)[

Mon smiles. "I'll hope to see you there." She hesitates, glancing over her shoulder as she turns to go. 

You're not sure if you're imagining the color in her cheeks. There's soemthing about her, something soft. You look down at the invitation again. There's a soft scent of lillies lingering in her wake. 

You retreat back to your office and the much more dull paperwork until at last, your com chimes to start your day. 

[[The senate]]

You turn back to your messages and manage to get a decent amount of work done before your com chimes.

You stand and stretch. Once more into the breach.

You step forward, as ready as you'll ever be to meet the new day.

You're blushing as you sit up. strands of your hair has come loose, and you brush them out of your face. Your hand brushes his as he reaches out to do the same. His fingers curl around yours. You go still as he gently smooths out your hair. Then as if purely to fluster you, he leans in and kisses the middle of your forhead. 

"W- what was that for?" You ask in a breathless voice.

"A thank you, for giving me an excuse to sit here for another hour and ignore the mess of the rest of the galaxy for a bit."

You manage a half sound, then you stiffen, hand still wraped in his. "What time is it?" 

"Quarter to eight."

"I'm late!" You stumble to your feet. You wobble and he catches you before you fall into the sand garden. His chest is a solid wall of warmth as he stedies you.

"Easy. I called ahead. There's a speeder waiting to take you to 500 republica."

Your face must be bright red. "Oh, thank you."

He gives you a moment then takes a half step back. He still has your hand, large callused fingers curled around your own. 

"Senetor?" He asks softly. 

You nod, steadying yourself. "Yes, I'm alright."

He nods. You almost feel like you're floating as he escorts you to the door. R2 beeps up at you when the door opens. Mace nods at the droid.

"I'll leave her in your hands?"

R2 swivled it's dome and whistles. 

Mace turns and half bows over your hand before finally letting go. 

"Until next time Senetor." He turns, and sweeps away down the hall. 

You let out a breath. It takes a moment, and R2 beeping a question in your direction for you to gather yourself and turn towards the hanger.

You blink slowly. It's been so long since you've felt this at peace with yourself and the world around you. Mace smiles, and brushes a strand of hair away from your forhead.

"Good morning." His voice is low, not a whisper but quiet in the small space. 

"Good morning," you answer. "I fell asleep?"

"Yes, but don't concern yourself with it. You seemed like you could use the sleep and even we Jedi masters sneek in a nap now and then."

You laugh light and easy. A small rolling strech and you sit up.  "Still, falling asleep on a near stranger..." You glance away.

"Well, I guess you can't call me a stranger any more." He waits a moment, then stands offering you a hand. His palm is warm, compleatly covering yours. "Ready to face the day?"

You take a breath and center yourself. Maybe it's the nap, or maybe the force, or something else entirely, but you feel confident when you nod.

"Good. I called ahead. There's a speeder waiting to take you 500 republica, or wherever else you want to go." He escorts you to the door with a hand on your elbow. The door slides open and R2 beeps up at you. Mace bows over your hand. "Until next time Senetor." Then he turns, sweeping away down the hall.

You gather yourself and turn towards the hanger.

Bail... 

He should know about the attack. He'll know soon enough but...

You open the connection, fully prepaired to be sent to a messaging service or a secratary. Instead his sleep-addled face apears. It's a hand-prijector, and blurry, squishing his features a bit as he yawns.

"Padme? What?"

"I'm sorry to wake you. There was an attack. I thought-- I thought you'd want to know first hand that no one was hurt." That you weren't hurt. Is that too presumptuous? Bail is older then you. He's been a friend and a mentor at diferent times. He's married, and clearly loves his wife...

The view blurs for a minute before settling, drawn back a bit. He's sitting on the edge of his bed, stipped down to a pair of sleep pants, chest bare. 

"Tell me what happened."

In simple sentances you lay out everything, your plan and the doubts you now have. He asks a few questions, little things. 

"What do I do?" You ask at the end of it. Your voice is small, there's a tremmor behind the words. 

Bail shakes his head, and runs a hand through his hair. He looks human in that moment. A man rather then a representitive. You want to lean into him, you might even do it if you were in the same room.

"The Jedi will handle the assasin. Trust them. They have their roles as we have ours." He leans back, and looks at something you can't see. He nods. 

When he looks back at you his eyes are a little clearer. "I won't blame you if you want to get a few more hours of sleep, but I'm going to go into the senate a bit early. You are welcome to join me if you like."

You nod. As tired as you are, the chance to feel like you're doing something would be welcome. "Thank you, Bail."

He returns the guesture, "Thank you for calling. I'm glad you're alright."

<!--Com Mace-->

Mace...

You open the connecton before you can think better of it. You don't expect him to answer.

The connection rings once, twice, thrice, then the connection opens and the view from a handheld holo opens. Mace looks like he's had less sleep then you have. His robes are rumpled, and there are circles under his eyes.

"Is something wrong Senator?"

"I didn't expect you to answer," You blink and shake your head, bringing yourself back to the moment. "No, yes, maybe." You take a breath and tell him about the assasination attempt, about the trap, and how Obi-Wan jumped out the window.

"Of course he did, why am I not surprised."

"Does he do that often?" Your tone is lighter then you expect, years of training taking over.

"More then you'd think possible. Please don't spread it around but Kenobi and Skywalker are the team the council sends in when we suspect things are going south. It's a miricle they're both still alive. I would have assigned you a different team, someone with more political finesse, but the Chancellor..."

You nod. "Well, at least I can hope they're unconventional tactics will prove usefull tonight."

He rubs a hand over his chin, studying you. "What will you do now?"

Your heart flutters. The way he's looking at you - like he's seeing the whole galaxy.

"I... I'm still figuring that out."

He leans forward. "If you need anything. If you don't feel safe. Come to the temple."'

You can't hide your surprise. "Master Windu--"

"You have my permission to call me Mace."

And now you're blushing. "Mace," you say brushing a strand of hair behind your ear. "I recognise that you are the head of the order and a very buisy man."

He waves a hand, "You are important. I know it. The force knows it. Your people know it." He raises an eyebrow and you can almost hear him asking if you know it yourself. 
(set:$mace to it+1)(if:$show is true)[

"Then, thank you, Mace. I will send word if I need to take you up on the offer."

He nods, satisfied. "Is there anything else I can help you with?"

You fold your hands together and gently shake your head. "Thank you."

With a final smile he closes the connection.

You sweep aside the contacts and look through the packet again. There, a hanger number. 

You go back through the reserch you did earlier. Their ship is docked in the same quadrent as your damaged transport. Now why would they rent a dock at a salvage and repare birth if all they wanted was a place to land?

"Stelth, there are only three of us. It would be too easy for them to slip out a side door if we hand them a distraction on a platter." 

Obi-Wan nods in satisfaction. Anakin frowns then rolls one shoulder in a shrug. 

The club is busy when you slip inside. There's a scent of sweat, and alchohal and something that might be perfume or might be a non-human musk. The three of you get a few looks and it's clear that Obi-Wan and Anakin are recognised as Jedi. It's a little odd not to be the center of focus. It gives you a moment to linger by the door. 

Anakin and Obi-Wan take a few steps forward, shoulder to shoulder, looking around.

"Do you see them?"

"Not yet."

Obi-Wan humms, "Spread out, see what you can find." He nods towards the dance floor, a collection of twisting bodies under purple and green twisting lights.

"Where will you be?" Anakin asks.

"The bar." Then they gance over their shoulders nearly as one. Obi-Wan lifts an eyebrow in question. Anakin is wearing a half smile that hasn't quite become a smirk.

Well, there's nothing like a bit of shock and awe to keep someone on their toes.

"Bluster then. one of you will need to circle around to the front. We'll go in this entrence and make a show of it. She'll either attack me, trying to finish what she started, in which case you can subdue her. Or she'll go for the obvious way out, in which case you can catch her as she tries to run."

Obi-Wan still looks a bit sour but it's clear he's thinking it through. 

Anakin just nods, "Got it, who's going to the front?"

<!--the political answer-->
You consider your words carefully. "Chancellor Palpatine has been a reprezentative of Naboo since before I was elected as Queen. During my reign he spent nearly all his time here on Coruscant. It was to be expected after he became Chancellor. On my end I had to manage the resposubuilities of a senetor until an off season election could be held. He'd never managed to keep a junor senetor on staff. None of them said anything bad mind you. Since I took over the job of Senetor two years ago he encoraged me to stay on Naboo. He said that he regretted becoming seperated from our people and he didn't want me to fall into the same trap. Of course, I was already used to balancing the workload at a distance so it was an esy step to offichally hire the aids that had been on retainer and just continue as things were."

When you come back to the moment Bail and Breha are watching you intently. 

"If I may ask, how often do you speak with him, in the average cycle?" Breha's tone was light, casual but you sense a weight under the words.

"Maybe once every two weeks by holo. There are regular reports of course, I was always aware of what he was trying to achieve, but those are mostly written and I suspect there were several layers of secrataries between us." 

Bail and Breha exchange a look. He gestures for her to speak.

"I know I'm not actually a member of the senate but I've been a politision for most of my life. When I look at the Chancellor, the patterns in his wake... I am not filled with confidence."

She's dancing around the heart of the matter choosing her words carefully. Your hands twist into your skirt. 

Bail speaks next. "I've met with him a few times, and I always get the impression that I can trust him, that he cares, but when I've talked to Breha, I can't properly explain why. I thought you might have more insight."

Is Chancellor Palpatine corrupt? Your gut reaction is to deny it. Of course he's not corrupt, not any more then anyone else. Yes the office of the Chancellor requires a bit of give and take. Compromise isn't easy...

<!--the personal answer-->
"I... know him, but I don't actually know him." He's been a coligue for a long time but I've only met him in person in a private setting a handful of times. As a person... I can't say I've always felt comfortable around him, but he's from a different generation, our views are bound to diverge to a certain extent. He's always argued for my safety."

Breha tilts her head, "Do you trust him?

You hesitate.

[[Yes, I trust him->3-26-1]]
[[No, I don't trust him->3-26-2]]


:: 3-22-1 {"position":"2900,2125","size":"100,100"}
You try for a sincier smile, but you're not sure how well it works. "The Chancellor is a good man. Bail was there when I spoke to him yesterday. It's a political matter but he insisted on Jedi protecton even when I protested. I might have dies tonight if not for that."

Bail nods slowly, glancing at his wife. Breha doesn't look entirely coninced but after a minute she nods. A sigh.

"The current situation has put a strain on everyone." Breha smiles at her husband. "I have to go, and you have to get ready for the day, but promice me you'll take care of yourself while looking after the rest of the galaxy?"

Bail nods. He's leaning in lik he wants to kiss her, but of course he can't, not through the holo. "Call you tomorrow."

Then her image flickers and fades. 

Bail looks to you. "I understand your position. Sometimes there are more shadows and mirrors in this city then there are buildings. Those of us who are honestly trying to do our jobs have to stick together." He stands and offers a hand. "Well, on to meet the day?"

[[Prepare for the day->3-99-2]]


:: 3-22-2 {"position":"3025,2125","size":"100,100"}
You hesitate but... There have been times when you felt... something. Something dark. Something cloying and sticky, like the smog in the lower levels. You bite your lip. 

"When I made the vote of no confidence in former Chancellor Velorum it was because Plpatine sugested it. He said he'd be better able to help Naboo, but in the years since, his focus hasn't been on our planet. I..."

You think back. How many times have you sent messages to him, demnding action in one form or another. And somehow he always makes you come around to his side of things, puts you off until it's moot or something else comes up, something vital and imidiate. 

"Something is wrong. I don't know if he's the one at the center but the senate is not serving the people as it should."

Bail looks to Breha and tilts his head. She nods.

"Padme, I know we've only just met, but I'd like to ask for your help. I believe that one of the reasons the Sepratist movement has gotten as far as it has is because someone or something blocked them from calling for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Palpatine. The average Chancellor only holds the office for five to seven years and he's had it for ten. It's not out of the realm of possibuility but with thi much conflict someone would have made the motion even if they were outvoted."

There's a heavy weight somewhere in your chest. "Are you planning...?"

"Not yet," Breha says. "But Bail doesn't have the personal reasons or connections to make the vote really effective. You do. If the rumor started that you were going to call for a vote, that you were looking for support, the Chancellor might come to you. You might learn something."

That's a lot of uncertainty. You're already being targeted. This would only add to it.

You close your eyes for a minute and think before you make your desision.

Anakin seems disapointed but a look at his master and he turns to slip around the building. 

Obi-Wan turns to face the doorway, lightsaber in hand. "Well then, shell we?"

Under all that disaproval there's a spark of mishchief. You almost want to take his arm. Instead you step forward, grab the handle and say, "On three."

"One"

"Two"

Anakin grins like a shark, spinning his lightsaber in one hand. You'd have to be blind not to see that he's having fun, and if you're honest, you are too. 

Obi-Wan huff and shakes his head but turns towards the end of the ally. "Give me two minutes to get into place." He says before he slips out of sight. 

You step forward, gripping the handle of the door and mentally counting down. 

"On three," you say and wait for Anakin to nod. 

"One"

"Two"

[[Three->3-24-2]]


:: 3-24-1 {"position":"4325,1200","size":"100,100"}
You tug the door open, and watch. 

Obi-Wan flicks out a hand in front of him. The flashing lights and thumping music falter. The screeens on one wal showing races and droid-ball flicker and turn to silent static. There's a moment of confusion as the croud looks around in surprise. Then Obi-Wan in there in the middle of them, somehow standing in an open space that wasn't there before. You didn't even see him move. The blue lightsaber that humms to life is the only illlumination in the room and the crowd fals silent. 

"My apologies, but will the bounty hunter who attacked my charge please step forward, I'd hate to disrupt these good people's evening any farther." His voice is light and calm, and yet it somehow rings through the whole space. 

Standing in the doorway you watch the croud, ooking for recognition, and-- "There" you yell as you leap forward. A figure, Purple leather, breatplate, just as Anakin described. Obi-Wan is there beside you, he sweeps an arm out creating a path. People gasp and cry out as you blur past them. 

They're headed for the front door. You have a spit second to make a choice.

[[hang back, Let Anakin capture them->3-29-1]]
[[charge ahead, capture them with Obi-Wan->3-29-2]]



:: 3-24-2 {"position":"4575,1200","size":"100,100"}
You tug on the doors and Anakin thunders through them, on a wave of wind and noise. You gasp, blinking past the images in your vission as you follow in his wake. 

Anyone and everyone near the doors has been bowled over. Glasses roll across the floor, brightly colored drinks painting the floor like an oil spill. The sound system screetches, before everything except a low base beet cuts out. The sparkling lights over the dance floor freeze in place. The lights by the bar flicker. 

Anakin must be doing something with the force because the are around him is clear. He's found a chair from somewhere, stepping up onto it like he owns everything around him. When he speaks it isn't a yell, but it somehow resonates through the whole building.

"I know you're here bounty hunter! Come out and face me. Or do you need to endanger innocents while failing your mission?"

If anyone in the building hadn't been aware of Anakin's presence, they are now. The gathering by the other door starts filtering out, taking the better part of vallor. Some start making demands, while others are frozen to the spot, watching raptly. 

Anakin draws his lightsaber, the green blade spinning to life, as he sweeps it over the heads of the crowd. 

You pull yourself back to the moment. Anakin is a wondereful distraction but if the assasin isn't headed for the front then you need to find them.

You shake your head. "The last thing we need right now is to devide ourselves further. I aprechiate your concern, but I will not sneek about and spread rumors. Not when I already have a target on hy head. There has to be another way."

Breha settles back in her seat and nods slowly. "I can understand your possition, and I don't fault you for it." She thinks for a moment then glances to one side. "I have to go. I love you, husband mine."

"I love you too." Bail says as the holo flickeers and fades. He takes a moment then stands. "Well, We both have a day in front of us. Oh and I've been wanting to introduce you to the Jr Senetor from Chandrilla. Her name is Mon Mothma. She's hosting a small get together this evening. I hope you'll consider joining me."

Breha leans forward with a small smile, "Thank you Padme, this means a lot." She glances to one side and streightens, "I have to go. I love you my dear."

"I love you too," Bail says, and then the holo flickers and fades. 

"I'll have some of my people start talking, send a few memos. In the mean time I'd like you to come with me to a gaathering this evening. It's being put together by the Jr Senetor for Chandrilla. Mon Mothma is a good woman and I've been wanting to introduce you even before these last few days threw a wrench in the mix."

He stands and offers a hand. "To meet the day?"

:: 3-26-1 {"position":"3200,2125","size":"100,100"}
You nod "I trust him." Even if a tiny voice somewhere in your heart is screaming no.

Breha leans back, looking into the middle distance. After a minute she sighs. "Perhapse I'm seeing threats where none exist."

"You would not be the first." Bail says. He lifts a hand then pauses and lowers it. 

Her shoulders drop a fraction. She starts to say something then glances away. "I have to go. I'll talk to you tomorrow."

"Love you," Bail says.

"Love you too."

The holo flickers and fades. 

Bail lets out a breath, braces himself and stands. "Well, We both have a day in front of us. Oh and I've been wanting to introduce you to the Jr Senetor from Chandrilla. Her name is Mon Mothma. She's hosting a small get together this evening. I hope you'll consider joining me."

"No I don't trust him." It comes out as a whisper, as if even here with friends, and behind layers of security you might be heard. Bail's hands close into fists in his lap. 

Breha lets the moment sit in silence before slowly leaning forward. "Padme, I know we've only just met, but I'd like to ask for your help. I believe that one of the reasons the Sepratist movement has gotten as far as it has is because someone or something blocked them from calling for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Palpatine.

You nod to Obi-Wan one last time. Anakin wraps an arm around your waist, tugging you forward. 

The throng of dancers melt around you, welcoming you in like a tide. Anakin wraps his arms around you. He seems able to keep a few inches between you and the others on the dance floor. You can't tell if it's the force or just a natural grace. He's moving with the music, mostly shoulders and hips. For a minute you close your eyes and let yourself revel in it. You could get lost in the rythom of the music, the low steady base, the winding brass, and something that might be birdsong. Instead You lace your fingers up around his neck, pressing against his front as you lift up onto your toes. He gasps, hips rolling forward. You whisper against his neck.

"Ahh, what?" Anakin stutters. 

"Can you see anything?"

Anakin presses his face into your hair. "Not yet. Look for dark purple leather, metal breastplate, helmet with a veil."

You are far from the tallest person around, but you spin, pressing your back against Anakin's front, arching with the music. You search the dancers with soft eyes. There? No, only a woman under a purple light. There? A young man in a corsit, not a breastplate. The crowd presses in on you. Maybe Anakin is having a better chance with his hieght. 

Something catches your eye, a glint of light off metal, a helmet? At the same time Anakin goes still. You glance up, he's squinting towards the tables. Does he see something?

You take obi-Wan's arm, put on a high sochiety smile and turn towards the bar. "Buy me a drink."

"Of course, my lady."

You get a few surprised looks and more then a few people get out of your way. Between his Jedi robes and the way you know how command a crowd, you probably look like a pair of upper-level old money  come down to slum it for an evening. 

Obi-Wan lifts two fingers and the bartender rushes to set down a pair of glasses before ducking away to help the next person. You turn, putting your back to the bar, and smile as you lean in to speak over the rush of music.

"Let me in on your plan?" 

He lifts his glass to his lips but you note that he doesn't actually drink. Instead he lifts an eyebrow. His free hand finds yours lifting the back of your hand for a kiss before leaning over it. 

"Now whatever do you mean?" He asks in a tone dripping with amusment. His eyes are sparkling. 

Oh? Is he going to make a game of this? Is he testing you? You consider how to respond.

"See somthing you like?" Your words are loud enough that the people around you might catch them. You add a little nod in the right direction to give Anakin the context the others lack. Even so it takes him a moment to ook away from you, eyes dark, face open with want.

"Should we get some space?" Anakin asks, and then before you can answer he turns and starts shouldering through the crowd. It's easy to slip along in his wake, unti you reach the wall, and a line of booths set back into it. A few of the ocupants glance at you, but they look away when you don't try to intrude. A table beside you cheer as something on a holo-screen turns in their favor. 

Anakin frowns then shakes his head. Not who you're looking for. 

A glance around shows that you, or at least Anakin is still gathering attention. You need to keep your cover.

He hesitates, then glances past you and his expression settles. "Of course." 

He lets you take the lead, on hand trailing from your shoulder down to your hand, lacing your fingers together as you slip through the throng, hunting for the flash you saw. Nothing yet.

There's a group around a table, chearing, they're clusteres close enough that you can't see past them. To your left is a set of stairs up to a second level. Someone could have gone up it.

"Jedi buisiness. Go back to your evening." (set:$clubMedia to false) 

Maybe it's the force or maybe it's the average blood alcohal level of the crowd, but they turn away acting like you were never there. Outside there's a cry. Obi-Wan is a step ahead. You rush the last few paces only to stop in your tracks.

Anakin has his lightsaber out, twisting through the air, leaving afterimages in your vission. His robes and hair are ruffled by the passing traffic zipping past bare feet from the edge of the level. The assasin has a long vibroblade in one hand, and a blaster in the other. rapid fire shots blinking into the background as Anakin effortlessly deflects them.

Before you have a chance to comprehend everything that's happening, Obi-Wan has stepped forward. He grabs the assasin's hand. She twists. The vibroblade whines. Obi-Wan blocks it with an arm and then his hand is in her face. Turn, a moment of balance, then she fell. Obi-Wan followed her to the ground. The blaster spun away across the pavement. 

Anakin deactivates his saber, stepping up beside you. "Are you alright?"

You nod. You're more familure with combat then many senetors, but you still have to catch your breath. 

Anakin joins Obi-Wan, hauling the bounty hunter to their feet. The few people around are mostly from drifting out of the bar. They're eyes glancing at you and then away, the mide trick still in place. Still better not to push it. You nod back at the ally. The Jedi follow.

You put on a burst of speed, grabbing the assasin's arm as they try to push through the confusion. They spin, lash out. You bring an arm out to block. The barrol of the blaster gets caught in your sleave. fabric tears. 

Something hits your leg. You loose your balance. Down, curl into a roll. You hit something - someone. They cry out. A flash of blue above you. A rush of force brushing past. Metal rings against the floor. 

You manage to push yourself up in time to see Obi-Wan kneeling over the bounty hunter, their arm twisted around behind their back. The figure you were thrown into turns and throws up onto someone's shoes. You scoot away from them. People are looking at you. Coms have come out. More then one is pointed in your direction. 

You stand, trying for dignity even as you keep your face as obsured as possible. 
(set:$danger to it+1)
Anakin comes through the door, seeing you and Obi-Wan and speaks, with an authority that almost surprises you. 

"Jedi buisiness. Go back to your drinks."

<!--Go to the temple--> (set:$clubMedia to false, $monInvitation to false, $maceIntroduction to true)

You convince Dorme to bring you some proper clothing. Something quiet, from the handmaiden wardrobe not the senetors. There's no way you'll get back to sleep. You try to do a bit of flimsywork, but it doesn't help. You feel like those creatures are watching you, still there, lurking, even though that's not possible. 

Those around you stop watching so closely and when no one it looking you slip away, R2 quietly eager at your heels.

The Temple. Ever since Mace extended the offer, it feels like it's caling. Not like duty or the force, more like a soft light on a dark night or the sound of water. You can't go back to Naboo, but the temple might sooth the preshure that the Senate pours over the whole planet.

Getting there is a bit of a blur. R2 is a decent enough pilot for city traffic. Then you're in the hangers, in the foyer... You realize you didn't send word ahead like you said you would. But it's the middle fo the night...

R2 sends a message in any case, but it's marked as not-urgent. You don't expect a response, and there's no imidiate reply.

You start to walk.

The temple is always open, always active to a certain extent. It's a city onto itself. There are public areas and areas where the temple guards stop anyone without the propper clearence. There are classrooms and meditation rooms and spaces for more phisical activities. At this time of night the halls are darker, lit by soft blue lamps. the crowd is split between nocternal speacies and those just returning from a late evening. 

It feels silly to think it but the air is lighter in these halls. Even without your guards, without a blaster hidden up your sleeve and a mask of customs and propriety, you feel safer here then you have in a long time. 
(set:$danger to it-1)
You let your feet carry you for a bit. At some point you find yourself in the doorway to a small room. There's a rock garden in the center of the space. Rocks and white sand, artfully tended into a spiraling fractal. Cushons set along the walls hint that the space is probably used for meditation. You leave R2 in the hall and slip inside.

You settle onto one of the cushons and let your eyes trace over the patterns. It's not true meditation, not like one of the Jedi could do, but each breath takes a little of the worry and tension, letting it bleed away. 

You close your eyes.

"Padme?"

When you open your eyes, Mace is standing in the doorwayHis clothing is as informal as your own, just a pair of linnon pants and a looseshirt, rather the proper robes. 

"Mace, I'm sorry. Did you come looking for me?"

He shakes his head. "I was going to meditate, This is one of my favorite spots. May I join you?"

You nod, the hint of warmth coming to your face as he cosses the room to sit beside you.

<!--Investigate your ship--> (set:$clubMedia to false)  (set:$monInvitation to false)
Slipping away it's simple. R2 helps, and distracts the others for you. You wrap yourself in non-desript servants clothing. Long sleves, and your hair tied back in a wrap. There are speeders avaliable and you take the oldest, a machene that looks sturdy but woud never win a race.  

R2 pilots, weaving through the traffic and eventually parking in an out of the way speeder lot.  R2 plugged into the local system and found the right hanger. You keep your head down. It's not hard to look like you're at the end of a long shift, flicking through nonsense on a tablet to look busy, as R2 leads the way.

You step through a doorway, glancing up, and miss a step. 

Your ship sits in the dim room. The charred right half of the hull is propped up on struts. The rest of the shards have been tossed in a pile, small sider droids, sifting through it, scanning and sorting with no reguard for the blood and char that stains them. 

There are no humans or other sentients at a glance. You wave the door closed, looking around, noting details. 

There's information, residue from the bomb, the location and force of the blast, the timing - just as they were landing... 

What to check first...

You talk to Corde. You talk to the Captain. Niether of them like you leaving so soon but senate is suposed to be safe. Your apartments were suposed to be safe. Anakin and Obi-Wan will need to report to the council. 

It takes longer then you would like, but at last you are dressed in handmaiden garb and on your way, R2 at your side. 

You reach 500 republica and go through the standard security. It's ealry enough that the lift is empty when you step into it. 

Now you just need to decide where to go.

<!--Go after the Jedi-->(set:$clubMedia to false, $monInvitation to false,$ch3 to "jedi")
Anakin and Obi-Wan's location flashes in your mind. You should think better of it, take a moment to be rational. Instead you stand and turn towards the door. A protocall droid with a mug of caff stumbles out of your way as you push towards the door. With one hand you signal to R2. The other grabs the caff as you pass. 

It only takes a moment to grab an outfit fit for the lower city. You're going to a club, the only thing you really need are credits and eyeliner. A copper wrap around dress that manages to hug your curves and hide multiple pockets is covered by a black jacket. At the last moment you grab a few scarves to cover your hair, and you're headed for the door. 

"Senetor!" Captain Typho steps in front of you like he's laying down the law. 

No not tonight.

You hold out a hand before he can say another word. "Do not try to stop me." you voice is made of shards of ice.

He startles. It's enough. You push past him before he can lock down the lift or do anyhting else to stop you. R2 is at your heals so even if he tried there wouldn't be much point. You'll deal with the consiquences later.

The speeder you find is compact and flashy and R2 starts it up without needing to be asked. sliding you through traffic with more speed then causion. You focus on the location icon more then the anger in your wake. 

There. 

At your word R2 comes to a stop in a side ally that definitly isn't a parking zone. You slip out of the speeder, dropping two feet to the ground. Anakin catches you, blinking as if he has no idea what to do next, now that he has you in his arms. 

"Padme?" Anakin asks.

At the esame time Obi-Wan says "Senetor,"

You take a step back, hold up both hands, and start talking before they can think too much about your sudden apperence. 

"I'm not going to let other people act for me. You want to protect me? Good. Jumping out windows and leaving me behind is not going to acomplish that. Now since I'm here tell me the plan."

Obi-Wan looks like he's swallowed a lemon and he's trying not to show it. 

Anakin either doesn't notice or ignores it because he starts talking. "The assasin's in there. I think they're a woman, and possibly a changeling."

You nod, "Right. Changelings can only shift to a certain extent. Hieght, and mass will stay the same. Someone needs to cover this entrence, R2?" The droid beeps and revs the enguin of the speeder still hovering over you. "Good. see if you can get eyes on the front as well. Now, stealth or bluster?"

"Excuse me?" Obi-Wan says as if she just sugested they run bare through the streets.

"Are we trying to tram them, her, or are we trying to scare her out of cover?"

"I know which one I prefer." Anakin says with a wide, slightly wild grin. 

Obi-Wan rolls his eyes. "Padawan," he says with bland disaproval. "we need not make enemies everywhere we go."

Seems you're the deciding vote, and you need to choose fast.

You glare at one of the women who are blaitently stairing, then step in, press yourself against Anakin's chest and tug at his collar. He catches your eye and there's something in his expression, awe, and hunger, and something that you don't have time to figure out. 

(if:$anakinKiss is true)[You slide your hand up into his hair, and tug his head down to your level. With the angle will they be able to see? You're not sure. 

"Trust me," you whisper against his lips, and kiss him. He goes still for a moment before leaning into it, dipping you slightly. ](else:)[Meeting his eyes, you silently ask him to trust you.

(set:$anakinKiss to true)
Someone behind you makes a comment. You barely hear it over the thumping of the music and the pounding of your pulse. 

Anakin is a quick learner, tracing the edge of your lips, before suddenly goint still. 

"Ani?" you lean back enough to ask.

"Danger." 

You hesitate, unsure if you should look around. Would it break your cover?

Anakin tenses, "Obi-Wan." He moves. His hand around yours, tugs you through the crowd. Too many people. Not enough room. A flash of blue.

The crowd pulls back and you almost fall into the open space around the bar. The assasin is leaning against a chair, a charred slash across one arm. Obi-Wan stands with his lightsaber at the ready, watching everything around him. He and Anakin exchange a look. You catch your breath as Anakin lets go of your fingers. He hauls the bouty hunter to their feet as Obi-Wan waves a hand at the uncertain croud. 

"Jedi buisiness. Nothing to worry about. Go back to your drinks." The average blood alcohol level probably helps wtih the mental sugestion. The two jedi march the stranger out into the ally, with you at following a step behind.

[[The assasin->3-31-1]]


:: 3-30-2 {"position":"3600,1625","size":"100,100"}
You turn to the nearest figure eyeing Anakin. She's a near human with an aquatic blue to her skin, and overly large dark eyes. She has the advantage of three inch heals but you still manage to look down your nose at her.

"Keep your eyes on people who want them. He's taken." Your voice is a bit too loud and you let the words slur just a touch. To add to the act you tug on Anakin's arm, wraping it around your shouders and slipping a hand up to play with the layers of fabric at the dip of his throat.

You chose your taget well. She rolls those too-big eyes and cocks one hip, waving a hand in your face. "What? The man can't talk for himself? Seems to me if you don't have the skill to keep him interested, then he'd be better off shopping the market."

You scoff, "and what, that's you? As if." You make a show of turning your back on her. Anakin is looking down at you in a daze as you twist your arms up around his neck. "Ani, I think I want a drink," you pout. "Buy me a drink?"

"I, yeah, sure," you can see his throat bob as he licks his lips. Then he blinks, his expression changing to something more focused. He loops an arm around you pulls you forward, towards the bar. You throw a victorious look back at the woman, just to stay in character. 

You spot Obi-Wan a bare second before he spins, lightsaber flashing. A figure falls back clutching their arm. The croud pulls back gasps and questions dancing on their lips. Obi-Wan  and Anakin exchange a look. You catch your breath as Anakin steps away from you. He hauls the bouty hunter to their feet as Obi-Wan waves a hand at the uncertain croud. 

"Jedi buisiness. Nothing to worry about. Go back to your drinks." The average blood alcohol level probably helps wtih the mental sugestion. The two jedi march the stranger out into the ally, with you at following a step behind.

You hang back as Anakin pushes the assasin up against the ally wall. Their arm doesn't look good but it's not going to kill them in the next few minutes. After everything that the evening has thrown at you, you're not sure what comes next. Should Anakin and Obi-Wan try to interogate them? Should they be handed over to the authorities? Are they the one who planted the bomb or was that someone else? Will someone else come after you?

R2 offers up a reasuring series of beeps. You pat his dome. 

"Who hired you?" Obi-Wan is asking.

The bounty hunter shrugs, then winces. "It was just a job."

"Who hired you? Tell us!" Anakin seems to be the bad cop of the pair. You're not sure how well it's working. The bounty hunter isn't really looking at them. You can't tell if it's the pain or some kind of anti-interogation technique.

"That wound is going to need treatment. If you cooperate we can help you."

The bounty hunter looks like they're going to say something else, but before they can there's a ripple in the air. Anakin and Obi-Wan both have their lightsabers out, and turning. 

"Into the speeder." Anakin calls. "R2 get her to safety!"

The bounty hunter twitches, falling to one side. What? Then you're being bundled into the speeder, and R2 is sending you into the sky. For a moment you think you see a figure on a rooftop. Anakin and Obi-Wan fall away below you. 

What?

You fumbe for your com, calling the Jedi. 

"Another bounty hunter," Obi-Wan says. 

And

"We'll take care of them, you need to stay safe." Anakin adds. then they cut the connection. 

You wait as R2 circles the skylanes for what feels like an age but the chrono tells you is less then twenty minutes. At last, you get a call from Anakin.

They tell you the bounty hunter is dead. They tell you the second bounty hunter got away. They say they need to report to the jedi council and possibly the chancellor. they've contacted Captain Typho who is not happy with you.

You lean back and close your eyes for a moment. This seems to be the end of your night, which means all you can do is try to get a moment of rest and prepare for the mess that the senate is going to be tomorrow. 

[[The senate]]

You push your way into a space around the table, smiling and chearing whenever someone turns your way. It's a game of chance, a galaxy wheel, and a random timer. 

"What's your bet, the droid at the center asks, holding a data-reader in it's hand."

You tug Anakin forward, leaning against his shoulder. You need a moment to look around. "What do you think sweety?"

He glances at you, meets your eyes for a brief moment.

The stairs are too narrow for multiple people. You press yourself to one side when someone comes down towards you. Anakin wraps an arm around your hips holding you steady. 

There's a veranda circling the room. It's quieter above, the music still beeting in your veigns, but the chears and talking are tucked into corners and around tables. Whoever you saw, they aren't obvious. You step up to the railing, eyes scanning the room below. Gaming tables, serving droids, people dancing, and drinking and...

"Obi-Wan," Anakin grips the railing beside you, he's looking at the bar. A moment later you see what he has. The assasin, slowly moving through the throng. Obi-Wan has his back to them. He doesn't know.

Anakin seems to know exactly what you need. He leans forward gathering eyes and attantion.

"Got to win for my sweatheart, right? Let's see, let's see, where's the winner?" He stretches out a hand letting it hover over the table. Maybe it's the force or maybe it's just that he's dressed as a jedi and playing it up. You take advantage of the moment to scan the people around the table.

A pair of women in matching outfits. A moncala with a high collar. A man, leaning against a basalisk, one of the latters arms pulling him into his side. A trio of young people who probably shoudn't have gotten in. 

No one matches the description. You slump a little. Whatever you saw, it's gone now. 

The wheel spins, and the planets light up growing and fading in intensity. You don't even know what Anakin chose, only that he's got an arm around your shoulder and he glances your way every few seconds.

The timer goes off. The wheel stops. Around you people cheer. You've won, or Anakin won. You smile as he turns to you. His arms wrap around your weist lifting you onto your toes.

"Congradulations," The droid said, "Play again?"

Before you can say anything Anakin's expression chages, eyes distant. His hand tightens on yours. Before you can ask he's moving. You turn, stumbling after him. 

A flash of blue light. The crowd pulls back and you almost fall into the open space around the bar. The assasin is leaning against a chair, a charred slash across one arm. Obi-Wan stands with his lightsaber at the ready, watching everything around him. He and Anakin exchange a look. You catch your breath as Anakin lets go of your fingers.

Anakin frowns, and shrugs, then glances at the table. There's something here, something in his expression, discomfort mixed with anger. There's something here that he doesn't like and you don't have the context for it.

The crowd is looking at you now, pushing, eager to get back to their game. 

The droid managing things tilts it's head at expectantly. "Are you going to play?"

You put on a smile, and lean into the act. Anakin will have to look around for both of you.

"How do you play?" You ask in an overly high-pitched voice. The droid gives you the short version. You keep your smile pinned in place, squeezing Anakin's hand under the table. You can feel the eyes on you, like an itch, an iritation that you can't acnoledge.

With your free hand you take his drink, and pointedly take a sip. There's a small clink as it lands back on the counter. With the hand he's still holding you draw him in. 

"Master Jedi, are you playing coy? Surely you don't think that I'm here blindly following along without a thought."

"My dear, I am well aware that you are far more capable then that." He brushes a free strand of hair behind our ear. To an observer you probably look like a lovestruck couple, lost in your own world. "And to answer your question, we are setting a trap." The words are barely audible, spoken into the skin of your inner wrist. He meets your eyes, and then slowly kisses your pulse point. His next words are louder, but still in that playful tone. "Or at least, that was my plan. I wouldn't dream of dictating the actions of a woman as capable as you."

He's giving you an out. It's kind and probably safer, if he really is acting as bait.

You toss your hair over your shoulder and laugh, still leaning into the act. Except when you meet his eyes you lift an eyebrow. 

"Oh darling that's hilarious, tell me another." You know he has a plan. Not only is he a Jedi master, but you've kept up with the missions of the two friends who once saved your life. The missions always have a kind of purposefull elegance even when Obi-Wan is dancing through chaos.

Obi-Wan tips his glass in your direction. "Your confidence in me is flatering, my dear. I do hope I can live up to your expectations."  (set:$obiwan to it+1)(if:$show is true)[`
{Obi-Wan Kenobi approves}
`] 
"Are you worried you're not up to the task?"

You don't know what it was about those words, but Obi-Wan streightens a fraction. His chin goes up, his posture settling into something determined and unmoveable. "Padme, when I took the task of protecting you I did so knowing that it could mean life or death. I am here because I am wholely confident that if it does come to that, the death will not be yours or mine."

"Oh," you're blushing, you can feel it. You're so close together, it's for the act but you weren't nearly as aware of it before. 

Obi-Wan stands, putting his hands on your hips, pressing you back against the bar. You can still hear the pounding of the music and the chatting from the people around you. The lights catch on his auburn hair, painting it white-gold, then purple and blood red. His eyes are unchanged, a clear sky blue, as he leans in and speaks just loud enough for you to hear.

"I'm going to ask you to trust me. Can you do that?"

Your breath catches in your chest. Oh, you've been playing with fire and didn't even realize it. He's never seemed tall or imposing but he's surouding you, blocking out the rest of the world. You can almost sense him curling around you even though you're not actually touching. 

Words. how can you possibly form words? A nod, you can manage that at least. 

"Good. Now stay right here. Can you do that my dear?"

Another nod. You're not sure you could move if you tried. If the bar wasn't holding you up your legs might have gone out by now. 

A glint of something behind him, light off metal. You open your mouth a warning on your lips but Obi-Wan is already turning. His lightsaber jumps into his hand. One blaster bolt ricochets up towards the cieling. Someone screems. It's not you, you can only gasp.

Obi-Wan throws out a hand, and the blaster goes flying. The attacker turns, purple leather, light bouncing off the helmet. They try to run. Anakin is there. One move, too fast to follow and the assasin collapses, clutching their arm. 

Obi-Wan't posture relaxes. He deactivates his lightsaber and hooks it to his belt. He runs a hand down the front of his robe, glancing at the crowd of people who have only started to realize something is happening. 

"Jedi buisiness, return to your evening." Obi-Wan't voice is light, casual. When he turns and looks at you, your breath catches all over again. How can he possibly be so many things at once and so gracefully?

He holds out a hand. Somehow you manage to take it. together you turn and follow Anakin back out to the ally.

You bite your lip. That wasn't quite... but it's out there now. Maybe it would be better if you just kept things profeshinal... Still, that doesn't stop you from leaning in so the people around you wont hear as you ask.

"You have a plan?"

Obi-Wan lifts his drink and speaks with his mouth hidden by the rim. "Anakin will flush them towards me. I'm acting at bait." He looks at you, concern and weight matched by acceptance. He's giving you a choice.

Sitting back you take another swallow of your drink, smile and say, "Save my seat while I powder my nose." You toss in a smile and turn, hips swaying as you head for the bathroom. As soon as the door slides shut you swap the scarf over your hair. Your jacket comes off, and you tug at the ties of your dress changing the silluette. Just under a minute later you exit the bathroom, sticking to the wall as you wait and watch. 

A handful of minutes later, you shiver. Then you see them. A helmet, dark leather. They're slipping through the crowd nearly soundlessly. The lights of the barrol of a blaster. 

Obi-Wan is expecting an attack but will he be fast enough? Will he be able to defend himself and capture them and keep everyone else safe?

You double down on your act. Swiping your ident over the scanner to place a small bet on a random slot. You look around with a wide smile and wider eyes, making aprechiative sounds as others at the table do the same. The droid starts the wheel and the timer, lights flashing. 

Behind you Anakin shifts. You glance up, and your smile falters. Anakin is looking back at the bar. 

You lean in close and whisper, "Obi-Wan?"

One sharp nod.

A bell rings. You glance back long enough to see that you've lost the bet. You pout for the crowd, and act up tugging on Anakin's hand.

"Honey, I lost! Buy me a drink to make me feel better."

Anakin glances at you, nods and pulls you forward. A flash of blue light. The crowd pulls back and you almost fall into the open space around the bar.

Anakin steps into a corner sheltered by the stairs and you tuck yourself beside him. It's quieter, and you almost feel like you have a moment of privacy despite the twisting lights and the music's heavy base.

"I'm sorry," you say.

Anakin meets your eyes and his face softens, the anger or frustration fading.

"I don't know what I saw, but they're gone now. I didn't meet to make you uncomfortable. I thought--" You cut off the sentance, biting your lip.

Your voice rings out, only to get lost in the thundering of noise from below. Beside you, Anakin throws out a hand, eyes half closed. You can feel something, rippling off him, like static. His robe flutters. Your heart skips a beat. 

The assasin steps up behind Obi-Wan, and freezes. 

Obi-Wan spins around, in a half crouch, then streigtens. He looks in your direction. Can he see you from this distance? You can't tell. He steps towards the assasin, and does... something. Beside you Anakin relaxes, that feeling around him fading. Obi-Wan nods towards the door, and frog-marches his attacker back towards the alley.

You meet Anakin's eyes. Together you make your way back down the stairs and Follow Obi-Wan outside.

You have to move, have to help him. You start to turn back to the stairs, but will they be fast enough? 

Anakin grabs your hand, pulls you close and then you're in the air. He's pulled you over the banaster. A cry escaps you as you start to fall. The crowd looks up mirroring your screem. You can see surprise, horror, excitement, and somewhere in the background you realize you should have hit the ground already.
(set:$danger to it+1)(set:$clubMedia to true) 
Anakin lands, and brings you down safely with him. Around you the crowd is whispering, Coms have come out, recording. No time. Obi-Wan is strugling with the assasin, lightsaber flashing. 

Anakin darts ahead. The assasin turns, too late-- Blue and green flash. The assasin cries out, falling back. There's a slash across their arm. A moment of silence as the room watches. 

You stop by Anakin's side. Obi-Wan lifts the bounty hunter up by their good arm, lightsaber back on his belt. 

"Nothing to see here, Jedi buisiness." Anakin says, and it's the most serious you've heard him.  
Mutely you follow as they march the woman back out to the alley. 

[[The Assasin->3-31-1]]

You call out. Obi-Wan turns, along with about half the crowd. A blaster bolt cuts through the air met by a band of blue. Something in the cieling breaks. 
(set:$danger to it+1)
You try to push forward but it feels like everythingis blocking you, the crowd, the fight, the very air. Obi-Wan's lightsaber spins through the air. The other figure tries to dodge. Somone slams into your shoulder. 

You stumble. Catch yourself on one hand and push back up. 

A flash of green, as Anakin joins the fight. 

Someone shouts. There are people with coms out, recording. Others are turning to run. A drink splashes across your front. You brace yourself, stick out your elbows.

"Calm," a voice rings through the space, Obi-Wan. The growing stampide falters until you can shoulder your way forward through the crowd. Anakin is holding the assasin. They have a long burt gash on one arm and aren't standing properly. 

Obi-Wan has a hand up, speaking to everyone around him. "There is no need to worry. This is Jedi buissiness. You may go back to your evening and know that this threat has been properly taken care of." 

You have to focus as a wave of calm and relaxation settles over you. A force sugesstion. You push through it. 

Obi-Wan spots you and nods back towards the ally. They slip out quickly. It takes you a minute to follow.

[[The Assasin->3-31-1]]


:: 3-38-2 {"position":"4175,1825","size":"100,100"}
You steel your nerves and stay where you are. The assasin gets closer... 

Closer...

They raise the blaster. Obi-Wan turns in a flash of movement and blue light. The blaster falls to the ground smoking. The assasin colapses to the ground clutching their arm. 

The crowd catches up with what's happening crying out and clearing space. Anakin steps forward. He sees you, nods, then turns to the gathered throng.

"Jedi buisiness, go back to your drinks."

Obi-Wan hauls the bounty hunter to their feet, Anakin providing an honor guard. You circle around towards the door, and slip back into the ally as the people around you start gossiping.

<!--Distract him with flirting-->
You pause, then lean back, making a show of reaching for your drink. Your eyes are half-lidded as you swirl the ice around the glass, take one last sip, then pluck out an ice cube and place it to your lips. He's watching you. He's not the only one, but he's the only one that matters. You suck on the ice cube letting watter drip down your fingers. 

"Well, that is quite a choice," Obi-Wan says and his voice is low.

"Not to your taste?" you ask, letting the remains of the ice fall back into your empty glass. 

"Quite the contrary," Obi-Wan's eyes roam over you, before he slowly leans back. His feet are planted wide, stance full of lazy strength. He holds out a hand, inviting you in. 

You take his hand and step in. Hs hands come up, as if he doesn't know if he's allowed to touch.

You slowly slide a hand up the neck of his robe, and lean in to whisper. "Do you see them?"

Obi-Wan's head tilts ever so slightly as his eyes track the crowd past your shoulders. "Hmm, not yet. Perhapse you should take a look." One hand on your hip, one hand curved around your shoulder, he spins you around him, trapping you against the bar. He leans in and his beard tickles your neck as he speaks softy into your ear. "Anakin should be heard them towards us."

You tip your head back, eyes sweeping over the crowd, and freeze. 

"What is it?" Obi-Wan's hands are still light, his touch soft, but the rest of him is tense as a wire. 

"I see them," it comes out as a breath. "Dark leather, helmet. They were in the north corner. Coming closer." You try not to look like you're stairing. As it is they weave in and out of your sight. 

"Anakin?" 

If you couldn't feel the tension in him you might call his voice casual. 

You swallow. Think through the fear, do not let it control you. Where is Anakin? There. 

"I think he sees them. He's behind them, a little to the left."

"Alright, here's what we're going to do-" his voice is still so calm. It makes it easier to breathe. "I need you to tell me when they are ten feet away. When they are I'm going to face them. I need you to stay exactly where you are when that happens, alright?"

You nod. Your heart is pounding and any act is gone but that at least, you can do.

The bounty hunter comes closer... closer...

"Now," you say, a little too loud, a little too high. You wrap pull your hands back, clutching the edge of the bar, your eyes squeezed shut. You can feel Obi-Wan move, hear gasps and cries, the hiss of a lightsaber-- 

You force yourself to open your eyes when you hear the cry of pain. It's not Obi-Wan, thank the force. And Anakin in there, standing over the assasin. The woman is clutching their arm, a lightsaber burn maring their armor.

"Jedi buisiness, no need to worry, go back to your evening." Obi-Wan says, waving a hand to the crowd. He turns to check on you, and his eyes are the cold blue of deep ice, then he holds out his hand and they soften. 

You take his hand for the second time, and the two of you follow Anakin back out to the ally. 

[[The assasin->3-31-1]] 


:: 3-39-2 [danger] {"position":"4175,1975","size":"100,100"}
You turn, prop yourself up on the bar and wave to the bartender. "Hey, over here. We're looking for someone." You lift your voice so that anyone nearby can hear you. "A bounty hunter. Dark purple leather, helmet, metal chest piece. We know they came in here. Have you seen them?" You get in the bartender's face, gesturing with exagerated motions. 

Obi-Wan steps away from you, and for a moment you think you chose poorly, then he gets in the face of a watching Gamorian. "Bounty hunter. Purple armor. Where are they?" His voice is so much harsher then it was moments ago. You're not sure if you're more surprised or impressed. 

The bartender puts up his hands, mutters something and backs away to serve someone at the other end of the bar. You turn and eye the person on the next stool, a thin stick of a man with a deathstick hanging from his limp fingers.

"You, You saw them didn't you. I swear to the stars if you try to hide them, cover for them--" Before you can finish he's already sticking up his hands and shaking his head.

"I ain't seen no one like that."

You jump on the opening. "That was a double negative. So you have seen them! Where? I know some very important people if you don't tell me I could make your life very hard."

He shuffles sideways and nearly falls off his stool. Obi-Wan apears beside him, lifting him off his feet and pressing him against the bar.

"You really do want to tell my friend what she wants to know."

The man makes a sound that's somewhere between a whimper and a squeek. "I've never seen anyone like that, I swear!"

"I don't think I believe you," you say, sweet as sugar, and cold as frost. 

"Talk," Obi-Wan adds, "Or I'll make it so you start rethinking your life choices." 
A little turn, a bit of a push, and the man looses his balance, falling to the floor. Hands up to protect his face.

The people around you are watching now. Some have slunk back, not wanting attention to fall on them. Others are just stairing like it's a show. A few have coms out and recording. 
(set:$danger to it+1)
You were trying to get attention but it's not exactly comfortable. 

Obi-Wan turns in a circle, raising his voice. "Well? Bounty hunter. Purple leather, Helmet. They attacked my charge. A Jedi's reward to whoever can bring me to them."

The crowd is looking around, muttering. Somoone calls out, and a second later you cantch a pointing finger. The people around you shift, opening a passage towards a figure in Armor, just like Anakin described. 

And speaking of Anakin. He's standing maybe a foot behind their target. With a snap and a hiss Anakin ignites his lightsaber holding it out so the blade extends over the bounty hunter's shoulder. 

"Don't move." Anakin says.

They still try to get away but a twist of his wrist and a gash is seared down their arm. Anakin grabs them, hauling them up. He nods to Obi-Wan. 

Obi-Wan nods back before turning to the gathering. "Thank you for your cooperation. The next round is on us." He tosses a credit chit on the bar, takes your arm and follows Anakin out into the ally.

You take a step back and slowly circle theough the crowd. Anakin has the rapt attention of eveyone still in the room, or almost everyone. 

The bounty hunter sees you a bare few seconds before you see them. It's enough that they already have a blaster out when you take a breath. They grab for you, and you react. years of self defence training and kidnaper preperation making you move even as your brain goes blank. 

A shot ripples past your ear, sound on that side of your head turning to a ringing drone. You slap out at their hand. The next shot goes wide. You claw at their face. The helmet spins away. They step back, turn. You're off balance, stumble. They pull you to the ground. You land on your shoulder. Needles shoot down your arm before it starts to go numb. 
(set:$danger to it+1)

Pull your head in, protect your neck. They twist at your wrist, and you cry out. 

The person over you stills. You strugle for an extra second, before you register the green light coloring the world. Sucking in air you manage to blink up over one shoulder.

The bounty hunter has you in a pin. It would only take a second for them to draw a vibroblade and slice into something vital. Except Anakin is standing over them with his lightsaber close enough to singe the hairs on their throat. 

"Move and it's your head," Anakin says, voice full of ice and anger. You didn't know Anakin was capable of sounding like that. 

For a minute the bounty hunter doesn't move, then the grip on your wrist relaxes. You gasp, as the strain on your arms fades. Slowly, the bounty hunter lifts their open hands. 

At the last secont they spin. Anakin is faster. A push with the force, a curve of his blade. They fall to one side clutching their arm, and gasping. Anakin stands above them, ready, and waiting. 

"I surender," They wheese, and the crowd releases a wave of chears and cries. 

You almost feel dizy as Anakin offers a hand and pulls you to your feet. He looks over you, checking for injuries.

"Are you alright?"

You nod, keeping your eyes on the assasin. "What now?"

"Go get Obi-Wan. I'll haul this one to the back."

You nod. Breathe. Obi-Wan. That's something you can do. One step at a time. 

The crowd clear the way for you. Obi-Wan must have realized what was happening because he meets you at the door. From there all you have to do is block out the people around you as you follow Anakin's path back to the ally. 

[[the assasin->3-31-1]]



:: 3-40-2 [Anakin] {"position":"4625,1325","size":"100,100"}
As you step back and glance around you see a narrow set of stairs heading up to a mezanine level. You go up them two at a time, dodging a stunned sering droid and catching yourself on the balcony railing. 

There has to be something. Everyone is watching Anakin, so who isn't? Who stands out? The bartender is tryong to pull someone down from trying to stand on a bar stool. Some of the serving droids are oblivious. Someone over by a gaming table is using the distraction to their advantage. 

There, the flash of light off a metal helmet. 

"Anakin, Right." You yell at the top of your lungs. The noise of the room has stilled enough that no one could possibly miss it. 

Anakin spins, stepping off his pearch as a blaster bolt passes through the spaace he was in. 

You stare, as mesmerized as the rest of the crowd as Anakin becomes a bur of brown roms and green light. Too fast to be properly human, each bolt harmlessly redirected up into the cieling or down into the floor. Then he's crossed the distance between them, flicking his lightsaber through the blaster. A miniture explosion and the bounty hunter falls to the floor, clutching their arm. 

In the sudden stillness Anakin stands over them. You can't see the expression he's wearing but from a distance he seems almost relaxed.

The crowd erupts in cheers, calling words of prais that all blend together. In the midst of it, Anakin looks up, finds you. He's smileing. He tilts his head back towards the ally. You nod.

Anakin turns away and says something to the crowd, summoning another cheer. It's a simple thing for you to fade back. 

You take a breath, in and out. Your heart is pounding but eveyone is okay. You need to make sure Obi-Wan knows what happened, if the noise of the cheering hasn't been enough to tip him off. 

Then, well, then you get to learn what this has all been about.

You shift. There's something under your head, something soft. A gental preashure sweeps from your crown down towards the back of your neck. You breathe a little deeper and realize you're on your side. 

The last thing you remember... Corde, the Jedi, the assasination attempt.

You fell asleep. When you open your eyes, Mace is looking down at you. You fell asleep meditating and now youe head is in his lap. He's stroking your hair. A part of tyou wants to blush, sit up, make excuses. Another part of you wants to stay right where you are.

<!--Blast location-->

You circle the remains of the hull. R2 wanders away, quietly beeping to the salvage droids. 

The metal of the hull is warped around one of the landing ports. There are traces of greese and ash, and something else... scratches? You slowly put together a theory. Another ship, one with minimal cross-section could have gotten close enough. maybe during entry, when you were getting flagged down to enter the atmosphere. If the device was attached to the landing gear then that would explain why it went off when it did. 

The important thing is that the blast is on the outside. The interior is damaged but from debries, not directly from the blast. 

You step back and continue your investigation.

R2 confirms that the black box has already been recovered and stored. Even the explosion shouldn't have damaged it. All the flight data will be there, and hopefully a clue about where and when the bomb was panted. 

You circle to the other side of the room where the box has been pluged into a console. It's standard procedure to copy the data before trying to sort through it. Except...

There's a man there, leaning forward under the controlls. He's human or near human, with dreadlocks pulled back away from his face.
It doesn't look like he's noticed you. You havne't been quiet, but the salvage droids must have covered your entrance.

You signal to R2. He brings out a spectrum light, slowly sweeping it over the wreckage. Your tablet picks up on the diferent wavelength intensity. It's not your area of expertiese, but you know people who would be very interested to have this information. 

Even a layman like yourself can pick out the darker patch of exhaust. R2 stops and holds the light in place, as you kneel. After a moment your tablet picks out something... lichen. 

Lichen is the bane of shipyards everywhere. Some strains can survive in a vacume for years. As long as it's close enough to the hull to be protected by the internal dampeners it won't even be whiped out by a trip through hyperspace. 

More importantly lichen adapts fast. Each planet, each biome, is unique.

You have to connect to the holonet to get a program to analyze it. Your fingers tap against the side of your tablet, as you force yourself to wait. 

There. Absolute proof. This lichen is not from Naboo. Now you just need to find a decent database with samples that you can compare this to and...

R2 rocks back on his struts, a little light going on. You're on your knees. Too slow. The stranger already has a blaster out and pointed at you before you can even finish turning around. 

"Don't move," comes a low masculin voice with a mixed accent.

The man is tall, human, or near-human, with medium brown skin and dredlocks pulled back from his face. There's a yellow stripe across his face, paint or tattoo, you can't tell. 

You put on a thick lower level accent and blink up at him. "You're not the Gonk droid. Is that a blaster? What are you doing with a blaster? Don't you know this is an ongoing assesment? If you contaminate it there wil be so much paperwork. Gods, and what'll I tell the supervisor? Can't just blame it on a droid, they don't have the prossessing power to turn on a lightbulb."

R2 beeps indignatly, getting into the act.

"Oh shush, You think I don't know abot the defrags? Everyone knows about the defrags."

The man let the tip of the blaster drop. Not out of the danger zone yet...

"You're not suposed to be here."

You roll your eyes, "What because of the overtime? They'll care if this doesn't get catalogued before whoever owned this ship comes asking." You put your hands on your hips, waiting for him to call your bluff. 

"No, I don't think so." He looks between you and R2. Then a slow smile spreads over his features. He slips the blaster into the back of his belt.

"Looks like niether of us are suposed to be here. So, you going to tell me what your interest is? Maybe we can work together."

His dreadlocks are tied back away from his face, the yellow stripe across his face draws your eyes, making it hard to pin down anything else. 

You slowly turn, waiting for him to either give another order or pull the trigger. Captain Typho would kill you if he ever found out about this. 

Your eyes catch on a tool pack straped to his thigh. With the way he's standing over you, it's right at eye hieght. There's patch tape there, but there's somethign else too, and not something you'd expect to see on a mechanic's belt. A length of pipe about six inches long. It might have just been scrap, easilly dismissable, if you hadn't seen something similar earlier this evening. 

A lightsaber.

A Jedi? Or is this another rogue darksider? You know it's possble. It's happened to you before. But if that was the case wouldn't you already be dead?"

"What do you want?"

You glance up, then pull your head down, but it's enough to see he's human, or near human. Dreadlocks pulled back away from his face and a mismatch of gear. He doesn't look like security. No uniform, no insignia, and the blaster is out of place somehow. 

You bite your lip. It's an act, and a good one. No one ever expects a small slender woman to be capable, and you know how to play into that. 

Except... the man tilts his head. The blaster wavers. Going for the blaster would break character but it is sorey tempting even if it woud be a risk. 

"...You're not afraid. Interesting." While you're still trying to figure out how he knows that he slides the blaster into the back of his belt and offers a hand with a crooked smile.

He looks you over, glances at R2, then shrugs. "I could ask you the same thing." He let's the blaster point at the floor, but doesn't put it away. "This ship is part of an active investigation. It's confidential."

"Oh really? Then I supose you wouldn't mind showing me documentation?"

A beet, then he smiles. "Seems like you don't have any paperwork either." He offers a hand, finally putting the blaster away. "Team-up?"

You take his hand. It's warm even through the glove. For a moment he seems to pull you in. There's something about him...

"Quinlan Vos, Jedi Knight."

Jedi, right. You let go of his hand, nodding as you introduce yourself. "Padme Nabare. I work with the Naboo Senetor." 

He snaps his fingers. "A handmaiden. I thought I recognised that look." He turns, glancing over the ship. "Well, if the senetor sent you I might be able to share what I've gathered. This attack isn't the first..." He trails off with a frown.

Your heart flutters. You knew something stank about this whole mess. "What have you found?"

He rolls a shoulder, taking off his gloves one finger at a time. "Not as much as I'd like." A step brings him to the largest part of the hull. He trails his fingers across it. "Assasinations, bounty hunters. If you're from Naboo, what do you know about the blocade a decade ago?" He turns back, rejoining you as you search for the right words.

"I worked for the queen at the time. I have a certain amount of seecurity clearence."

His hand lands on R2's dome. The little droid beeps and turns to look between him and you. Quinlan stares off into the middle distance, for just a moment too long, then he takes a deep breath and nods to himself. 

"You should come to the temple with me. I'm just a part of things, but Master Windu can give you full access."

It's your turn to pause. Master Windu? The head of the order? He's not the kind of person you just go and talk to, even someone with your status. You hesitate, but he's a jedi. Anakin and Obi-Wan couldn't have been assigned to protect you without the master of the order knowing.

R2 is at you side. He beeps, but you're too distracted to try to translate. Hopefuy the droid has what you need.

The man tilts his head as you circle each other. Then he shrugs and steps back. You circle him, watching sidelong. He lets you leave.

You let out a breath as you step into the hallway. You don't have as much information as you would have liked, but... At least it's something. R2 leads the way back to your speeder. You sag into the seat, glancing at the clock in the dash. The sensible thing to do would be to go back to your rooms, and maybe get another hour of sleep before you have to meet with Bail... Or you could go to the Senate now. Get a jump on things...

You fall into the bed, pull the blanket over you and close your eyes, knowing that morning will come all too soon.

You bathe and Dorme helps with yout clothing and makeup, not as formal as when you were queen, but formal enough to make a statement for the senate. 

As a group, security, handmaidens, Jar Jar and all, you decend on the offices of the senate. 

[[The senate]] 


:: 4-1-1 [danger] {"position":"5075,975","size":"100,100"}
"Let's take a look at the slavery case."

Dorme shifted several piles around until they found the relavent documents. 

"Alright, here's the summary: A group of slavers were aprehended in Ryloth space. There was something off with their permits which is why they were flagged. Then two of the slaves came up on a list. The senetor is claiming they're wanted as terrorists and rebels, and has ordered them to be handed over. The slavers are saying that they sold themselves into indenture under the full rights of Ryloth law and if the state wants them they need to be paid." There's a soul look on Dorme's face as she sighs. "It seems like senetor Orn Free Taa is using this to throw his weight around. You know I don't like that guy, but we don't want him as an enemy either."

You drink some caff hoping to fight off the oncoming headake. "Alright, let's go over some of the details."

The details take up the next fourty minutes and in the end it's not any clearer. The whole case is full of finger pointing and he said, she said with next to no documentation. After a while Dorme leans back and looks at you.

"Time to make a desision."

"Let's look at the preservation proposal."

Dorme takes a moment to pull up the relevant documents. The two of you spend the next half hour fighting through the legal jargon and ornate language. 

Eventually you lean back cover your eyes, holding up your free hand. "Okay, let me see if I understand this fully. The Jedi Agricore is asking to capture a sample of Naboo Fauna, specifically fish and see if they can crossbreed them with a population on Corellia because the pollution there has stunted the growth cycle. But there's a chance they could be introducing something invasive so they need a controlled environment on both planets as well as permits and the surrounding things to collect and transport and all that. Is that how you understand it?" 

Dorme is rubbing her temples, but she nods. "Between all the rest of it."

You close your eyes and nod. "Did they include a budget estimate?"

Dorme humms but a minute or two later she answers "I don't think so."

You are seriously tempted to pass this over to Jar Jar. He is a Jr Senator...

"Our stance on the war. When was the last one we put out?"

Dorme scrolls through your internal documents. "Three weeks ago, just after the announcement from Mandalor."

"Can you pull up some refrences of the major events since then?"

You spend the next hour and a half reviewing votes and motions and the media's reaction to events. Summarizing your views and the views of Naboo on the greater conflict isn't easy, but it's your job. You've got experience. There's just one thing...

Your personal views conflict with Chancalor Palpatine's stated intentions. You should show a united front, since you're both from Naboo, and he is the Chancellor of the republic, and yet...

"Better to deal with the club mess now rather then later" You say, mouth pursed into a thin line. 

Dorme nods, pulling up  the media request. 

You spend the next chunk of time combing the holonet for shaky videos and identifying figures. It's a mess, but not an unsolvable one. The videos are mostly of the Jedi. You won't be able to wear that dress again, but... You can probably say that it wasn't you without too much pushback.

Except... is that what you want? You consider...

"Tell me about the invitation, that seems like it'll be simple." 

Dorme pulls an actual piece of stiff flimsy from a pile and offers it up. 

(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-colour:white)[
''You are cordually invited to attend a gathering on the evening on Tongsday evening being hosted by Chandrilla and her senetors. ''

Jr. Senator Mon Mothma

]

You pause, looking at the signiture. It looks like Mon Mothma actually hand signed it, not printed or typed. That spoke of a great deal of time or a great deal of respect. 

"What do we know about Mon Mothma of Chandrilla?" You ask. 

Dorme taks a sif of her caff as she taps at her datapad. "She's an ally in the war effort. You and her are actually around the same age. Her senior representitive was a bit of a tradishonalist but since he went back to Chandrilla she's been making waves, or at least trying to." 

You make a face, you know how that goes. 

"She's not on any of the same commities as you, but she's supported four proposals that Bail has submitted."

You nod a little, trying to think through all the angles. "Will there be time tonight?"

Dorme shrugs. "That's up to you. You'r calendar is open but there's a lot to attend to."

You let out a slow and solumn breath. "What time is it on Naboo?" You don't really need to ask, but Dorme answers you anyway. 

"Mid-afternoon."

You nod. "I'll make the call to Corde's family. You can step away if..."

Dorme shook her head. "I'll stay. She was my friend too."

You nod. She takes your hand. You clear the desk, pull up your holoprogram, and make the call. 

It's the hardest thing you've had to do in a long time. You don't try to stop the tears. Both of you are a mess by the time you end the call. You lean over and the two of you wrap your arms around each other, giving and recieving the comfort you haven't had time for up until now.

Eventually you lean back. As much as you don't want to get back to work, you have a duty, and Corde wouldn't want you to stop fighting for her sake. You spend a few minutes putting yourself back together.

"Back to work?"

Dorme nods "Back to work."

"Master Jedi, Oh-" You pause upon entering the main meeting room in the Naboo offices. Obi-Wan and Anakin you expected, the third figure is a surprise. (if:$maceIntroduction)[Mace smiles at you, a smile that might be ammused or might be resigned gracing his face as he nods to you in respect. He guestures for you to come in and join them at the table. ](else:)[Mace Windu. You recognise him even if you've never met. He stands bowing with his hands in his sleves until you've taken your seat. ] Spreading your skirts around you, you fold your hands together on the table.

"May I assume you've learned something about the threat to my life?" you ask.

Anakin takes a breath, then seems to remember himself and glances at the senior Jedi without actually speaking. Obi-Wan motions to Master Windu. 

"We have, but the Chancellor should be joining us in a moment--" A light flash on the holotable as Mace finished. You wave a hand over the console, accepting the call. The upper half of the Chancellor appeared in a map of blue light. He turned, took in the people gathered and stepped in before anyone could make a formal greeting. 

"Ah, Padme good, and Master Windu. I apologise, but I only have a few minutes. Is it true you were attacked again last night?" Chancellor Palpatine's voice rises at the end hinting at concern that is otherwise masked by his political training. 

You nod slowly, glancing to Anakin and Obi-Wan. The Jedi likely have a full report, but you don't know if it's reached the chancellor's office yet. 

Mace steps in. "Yes. To summerize: A bounty hunter by the name of Zam attacked  Senetor Amidalla just after midnight. (if:$trap)[ Master Kenobi and Padawan Skywalker had set a trap for them, and were able to first scare them off and then persue them to a club in the 7395 sector. ](else:)[Master Kenobi and Padawan Skywalker were able to defend the Senetor and retreat with her to a saferoom until the threat had passed.] Master Kenobi is at the front of the investigation which is ongoing."

Palpatine nods, folding his hands together. "I see. I was afraid of this. I have to assume that the separatists are trying to force us to act. This level of violence and aimed at someone so close to me, such a proponent for the peace effort..." He shakes his head and meets your eyes. "Padme, you are not safe here. I'm afraid I must insist that you return to Naboo. Master Jedi can I count on you for your continued protection?"

Mace is frowning ever so slightly. Obi-Wan looks distant, stroking his beard, so it's left to Anakin to respond.

"Of course Chancellor. Padme's safety is our priority."

"Thank you my boy, I knew I could count on you."

You purse your lips and a line forms on your forehead. As you take a breath you are well aware that with the Chancellor and Master Windu, two of the most powerful men in the galaxy are listening. 

“I appreciate your concern and your protection but I’m worried that going back to Naboo will do the oppositions job for them.” 

Palpating nods sagely, he’d probably be patting your hand if he was here in person. “You are dedicated, but you must think of your own safety as well. How will you face the next challenge if this one becomes your end?”

It makes sense but something, some instinct is urging you to stop and think. Before you can figure out why the. Chancellor glances to one side and nods to someone out of range of the holo. 

“I must go. I leave Padme safety in your capable hands.“ he nods to the Jedi and the holo flickered off. 

You close your eyes and breathe for a moment. This is not how you hoped things would go. His concern is touching but you are more capable then he's acting. 

"It seems you have a choice to make." Mace's voice is low and steady. When you open your eyes he's watching you with his hands folded in his robes. You start to ask for clarification but you realize he's right. 

Whatever you choose here and now might have repercussions for the whole galaxy.And even if take the Chancellor's advicec and think of yourself. There are relationships you've only just started to cultivate. Who do you truely want to spend time with? You wont be able to change your mind down the line. 

You don't need to make this choice alone.

Obi-Wan stands next. He nods to you, and rests a hand on Anakin's shoulder. "Anakin will stay with you while Captain Typho and I work out the details. Why don't you go back to your quarters and put your things together. The faster you're off-planet the safer you'll be."

You nod mutely. Soon enough you find yourself shuttled back to the quarters that never actually felt like yours. You pack and talk, venting your frustrationg to Anakin's sympathetic ears.

"I understand," he says, and it's sharp, alost cold, with a kind of longing under the words. "I'm going to go... meditate." He turns and stiffly walks away.

The transport ship is old and worn down. You can feel the thrum of the hyperdrive through the rattle of the floor. There are bunks but only enough for half the passengers. The nocternal denezens and those who are willing to shill out a few extra coins, have monopolized them. You quickly end up in the common area with the rest of the passengers. It's dull and gray, there are crates piled up, and covered in netting forming a sembalence of structure and privacy. 

A day and a half to Correlia. Change ships. A day more to Naboo. A quick stop in to see the queen and then you and Anakin will hole up in whatever safe house is deemed most advantagous. 
(if: $danger >= 4)[
Anakin is leaning against the crate beside you. He settled down and closed his eyes when you entered hyperspace. You can't blame him. He's likely gotten even less sleep then you have in the past two days. 

Stars. Only two days. 

Beside you, R2 beeps, swiveling it's dome towards the food bar. You nod and wave it away. You could eat, even if you're not really hungry. It rolls away. 

You shuffle, trying to find a comfortable possition, your overcoat wrapped around you. Beside you, Anakin shifts. You glance at him. His expression is concerning. He almost looks scared, muttering in his sleep...

"Sorry," he says one hand scrating at the back of his head. 

"No need to apologine for a nightmare." You offer a hand, helping him into a more comfortable possition.

You clear off a cargo crate and accept to food that R2 has brought.

"I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far
the most beautiful place I've ever seen..." Anakin is watching you. His gaze is so intense. It feels like he's seeing into the depths of you. Is that the force or just him? A part of you is uncomfortable, but another part is thrilled, the same part that makes your blood sing when you've been backed into a corner with a blaster in your hand. 

"It may not be as you remember it. Time changes perception." Anakin is certainly differnet from the little boy you remember.

"Sometimes it does... Sometimes for the better."

You look down at the food. Pick at your roll. Your face is warm. (if:$anakinKiss)[You've kissed, but you haven't had a lot of time to think about that. About what it means for the two of you.

"It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like..." your words are distant. half buying time to think, half probing for his reaction.

"Or be with the people I love." His gaze is unyealding.

And there it is, the heart of the matter. "Are you allowed to love? I thought it was forbidden
for a Jedi." There are a lot of rumors about the Jedi. A lot of misinformation. 

Anakin sits back slightly, posture streightening. "Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love."

"You have changed so much." You hesitate. He must see it because he tilts his head, waiting.

What do you want?

[[You want a friend->5-7-1]]

You reach out, take his hand. "Anakin, what's wrong? Talk to me." You keep your voice soft. you don't thinnk anyone is listening, but you're not alone by any means. 

Anakin looks a bit uncomfortable, but he tilts his head and turns his hand, lacing his fingers with yours. 

"Dreams." Anakin says. "Nightmares really, or visions. I don't know. Obi-Wan says to stay in the moment. To let go of my fear... trust the force."

You want to hug him, but you're not sure if it would be accepted. "Sometimes, it helps me to talk about it. Bring those fears into the light..."

He glances towards you, then leans into your side. His eyes are mostly closed, just a hint of blue, turned to gray in the electric orange of the ship's lighting. 

Anakin humms, his thumb stroking over the back of your hand. "Do you remember my mom? I haven't been back to Tattooine since we left, but I've been seeing her in my dreams. There's a farm. Not one like you might have on Naboo, a moisture farm. And tuskens. They grabed her. She tries to fight but then they hurt her. They drag her into the desert. She's thirsty and hungry and they tie her up. She's strong, but she's scared." His head dropps forward and he lets out a shaky breath. "I can't help thinking it's real. That something's happened to her..."

You're not sure what to say. Dreams you could speak to, but when the dreams might be real... That's something out of a story. 

"Does it feel like a dream or..."

He shakes his head. "It feels real." 

You squeeze his hand. A minute later R2 comes up, a bread roll clutched in his grabber.

Anakin tilts his head to the droid. "Thank you R2." He looks at you and the dream seems to fall away a bit more. "Hungry?"

"Starving," you say and accept the roll.

After a few minutes of just listening to the ship around you Anakin speaks in a distant voice. "I see my mom in my dreams. A part of me is worried. What happens, it's terrible, and there's a part of me that's terrified it's real. Obi-Wan keeps telling me to release my fear, to not let it control me, but if I see her... I haven't seen her since we left Tattooine. Years and years, and if I see her in my dreams at least..." His voice falters.

"I can't imaguine that." You're voice is distant. You don't want to break his flow.  

"No one at the temple has a family. Well, I have Obi-Wan and there are other padawans, my friends, but it's not the same, not really. She's my mom. I never want to go back to Tattooine. it's a horible planet, but never seeing her again." His head falls forward. His hand is shaking in yours. 

You wonder what his dream was like. What did he see to make him say that? You talk to your family at least once a week. Shmi was so kind. leaving her there, it was wrong. You should have done something back then. If not you, then the Jedi.

You squeeze Anakin's hand. A minute later R2 comes up, a bread roll clutched in his grabber.

Anakin tilts his head to the droid. "Thank you R2." He looks at you and the dream seems to fall away a bit more. "Hungry?"

"Oh, umm, are you hungry?" You ask, and it would be a surprise if you weren't blushing. 

Anakin levers himself up. "Yeah I could eat. Thank you R2." he takes the roll and breaks it in half, offering you the other part.

"Pet names already? How forward of you."

You bite your lip. "No it's okay. I've never had anyone call me something like that. I guess I'm not used to it.

He finds your hand, squeezes it. "You are an angel, to me at least. You do so much good, even when no one asks you to. You'd throw yourself into danger, and help strangers, and fight the battles that no one thinks you can win. Maybe Angel isn't a good enough name." His belief in what he's saying comes though in every word, sending butterflies fluttering in your chest. 

How could you possibly respond to a decleration like that?

Before you can find any words, R2 comes rolling up with a loaf of bread in it's grabber. It beeps a question at the two of you. 

"Oh, yes, thank you R2." You mostly manage not to stumble over your words. 

Anakin finds your hand and kisses the back of it before taking the bread.

"I want to be your friend. I want to be able to trust you with my deepest secrets and yell about all my frustrations. I want to have you in my life. You know me in a way that no one else does. You've seen me helpless and desperate and you've seen me victorious. You don't work for me. You don't bow to me. You aren't someone who has some agenda that I need to butter up or keep happy. You're just you. You've always been on my side. I want that. But... I don't want anything romantic. I can't, not right now. I just lost a close friend and everyone is tugging me one way or another.

"I... Before... The kiss?"

You look away, and your expression must be telling. "I got a bit carried away? I like kissing but anything more then that... it would be too much."

He takes a minute one hand still holding yours as he leans back and lets his gaze play over the suroundings. Hints of emotion play across his face unti finally he lets out a breath.

"Okay. I thought... but I guess I was wrong." ]

"I want that too. I want to be with you. Ever since I saw you again, I can't think about anything else." 

You turn, tilt your head and he finds your lips. The kiss is soft, hidden away between you. A little secret that is wholey yours, and the rest of the universe can mind its own buisiness. 

R2 beeps, a touch of sarcasum somehow coming through as it makes a show of putting another roll on the makeshift table.

Anakin's expression could be a sunrise. He licks his lips, glances at the crate between you, then stands. He drops to one knee beside you, reaching out slow and deliberate to cup your face. 

"I really want to kiss you right now."

That fluttering in your chest is back. You manage to nod. Then he leans in soft and so very careful, like he's still figureing out what he's doing. When you pull back you have to catch your breath. Then R2 beeps and you glance around. You pat at your headscarf, rearanging it as heat rises in your cheeks. 

Anakin meets your eyes as he stands, and shuffles back to his seat.

Going back to eating feels like you're playing a part. For the rest of the meal, you keep glancing up, meeting Anakin's eyes, and glancing away again. The smile he wears tugs at your heart. That smile is for you, only for you, and you pan to keep it close.

The next mourning, ship time, you arrive in Correlian orbit. There's a transfer station on the moon Gus. By the time you land, you and the rest of the passengers have all gathered your belongings, credit chits and transfers in hand. 

Anakin gives you a nod, as you disembark. He takes the lead, R2 at his heals. The spaceport is  stuffy. Smelling metalic and smoky in equal measure. The platforms and launch bays are cordined off behind shutters and airlocks. bioscanners and security checkpoints link the different areas. It's the kind of burocracy and tedium you'd find in any decent sized spaceport.

You stand and guesture to Dorme. "Jedi, Captain, Dorme and I will return to my quarters and prepair. I trust you to make the preperations on this end." Before they can protest or comment you turn and sweep out of the room.

Dorme waits until you're in the hovecar to ask, "What are you planning?"

"Who me?"

She leans back and rolls her eyes, something she'd never dare do if you had any kind of audience. 

"Okay," you admit, "I want you to go with Anakin while I stay here and investigate."

"Are you going to sneek off with Master Kenobi? What a scandle."

"Only if he catches on," you grin. "so you'll do it."

"My lady, it will truely be a hardship to go on a vacation with a handsom young jedi." she presses the back of her hand to her forhead as if she might faint. You snort. She laughs. "But really, are you sure? You'll be putting yourself in a lot of danger and noone of us will be there you help you."

You nod. You are well aware of the danger, but this is your choice and you're not going to turn back. 

Dorme watches your face, and nods. "Okay. I supose there's a reason you were the youngest queen in living memory."

When you get back to your rooms the two of you move in sync, puling out clothing and makeup. Dorme still looks close enough to pass for you with a few tricks. It helps that Anakin doesn't actually know you that well yet. 

You're ready by the time Anakin, Obi-Wan and Captain Typho arrive. You see Dorme off at the spaceport. You thank Obi-Wan with a bow and a micro-tracker pinned to the sleave of his robe. Captain Typho drops you back at the Senetorial quarters before heading to 500 Republica to meet up with Jar Jar. 

You wait a full ten minutes before slipping away and down to the shuttle bay. Without R2 you coud either pilot yourself or board a public shuttle. The former woud be more flexible, the latter would be less conspicuous.

Before making your choice, you pull up the location of the tracker. If Obi-Wan returned to the temple... but instead it looks like he's still close to the shuttleport. A public shuttle it is.

You slip into the diner, sliding onto a seat at the bar. You order caff, holding up your tablet to watch Obi-Wan in the reflection. He finishes ordering and leans back in his seat, looking around the diner. 

A few minutes and a cup of caff later a baselisk comes out of the back. He must be one of the cooks because he's wearing a stained apron and tugging up his pants with one hand. He comes over and Obi-Wan stands, embracing him like they're old friends.

"Hey ol' buddy," The baselisk drops into the seat accross from Obi-Wan. "So my friend, what can I do for ya?"

"One moment. I have a friend who should be here momenterraly." Obi-Wan glances at the door just as it opens. A kiffar in Jedi robes looks around then grins and heads streight for Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan scoots over to give the man room.
(if:$quinlanIntroduction is true)[
You recognise the second Jedi: Quinlan Vos. You supose it makes sence since he seems to already have knowledge of the investigation.

"Quin, Haven't seen you in an age," The cook says and heartlly shakes the mans gloved hand.
(if: $trap is true)[
Obi-Wan reaches into a fold of his robes and produces a small bit of metal and electronic. "Can you tell me what this is?"
](else:)[
Quinlan ruffles through his robes until he comes up with something small and metalic. "Any idea what this is?"
]
The Baselisk carefully rolls it into one palm. "Well, whaddya know... I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim."

"Can you tell us where it comes from?"

"This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino saberdart. Used 'em to hunt sharks, and other things..."

"Kamino saberdart? ...I wonder why it didn't show up in our analysis archive." Obi-Wan asks stroking his beard. He glances at Quinlan. The other jedi shrugs.

The baselisk rolls his enormus shouders. "It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away... Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom." He lets the dart fall back to the table.

"Hey, blame the programmer not the droid," Quinlan says, leaning back, but he doesn't sound all that upset. 

Obi-Wan picks up the dart, looking at it in the light from the window. " Kamino... doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?"

"I don't recognise it," Quinlan says. The look he and Obi-Wan shares says that means something.

"No, it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive. These Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones, too."

"I don't like the sound of that. There's a reason cloning is carefully regulated inside the republic," Quinlan says.

Obi-Wan nods, "Are they friendly?"
 
"That depends," the baselisk smiles, "On how good your manners are... and how big your pocketbook is..."

"Yeah, that figures. Anything else you can tell us?" Quinlan asks.

"Not much. It's a water planet I know that, but I never actually visited, just worked with people who worked with 'em. They had a reputation for working with anyone for the right price."

Obi-Wan and Quinlan share a look. Niether of them seem exactly happy. 

"Afraid that's about all I can tell ya' unless there was something else?"

"No, you've been a huge help. Thank you my friend." Obi-Wan says.

The Baselisk nods and levers himself to his feet, heading into the back.

Quinlan waits a moment before asking. "Nothing else?"

"Well, as you'd like," Obi-Wan lifts a hand inviting Quinlan to go on. 

Quinlan turns in his seat and looks right at you. 

You freeze. Is there room to get away? To play it off? Maybe, but if you do, you'll compleattly lose track of them and the investigation. 

Quinlan stands up and comes to lean against the counter beside you. "Join us?" he asks.

Well you didn't really expect to stay hidden forever. You push back your cup of caff, and turn to take the baselisk's empty seat across from Obi-Wan.

"Padme." Obi-Wan greets you. "You are playing a dangerous game."

"Are you going to make it more dangerous?" You keep your tone even. 

Quinlan slumps down next to Obi-Wan, stretching his arm over the back of the bench. "I'd rather not if it was al the same to you."

"The council directed myself and Anakin to protect you. I'm willing to keep you close if you'd prefer that to the more tradishonal protection."

It's flowery language but it does fall in line with what you want. "Then I'd like to share resources on this matter. You have a lead, I'll help follow it."

Quinlan offers a mocking half grin. "Two leads actually."

You raise an eyebrow.

"There's the dart, and the bounty hunter we found it on." Obi-Wan elaborates. "Quinlan has already started going after the latter. I will be looking into the former."

Which leaves you with a choice, and very little information about the paths in front of you.

<!--follow Obi-Wan-->
You duck your head and step forward, trying to stay about ten paces behind Obi-Wan. The strets have a decent amount of people, enough that you can blend in a bit. It helps that Obi-Wan's brown robes are rather distinctive. 

He heads for the local shuttle station, and turns towards the platform for the university and temple sectors. You stop behind a pillar to let down your hair and tie your jacket around your hips, changing your siluette before pulling out a tablet and stepping onto the platform. Just another person keeping buisy while waiting for the train.

You make sure Obi-Wan is heading for the doors before stepping onto the train yourself. You're in the same car, but further down. About half the seats have been taken, so you perch on an open one by the door, tilting your tablet to keep Obi-Wan in sight. 

He waits until the train is moving before standing from his own seat and moving down the aisle between the seats. You turn towards the door. Heartbeat rising, you keep a board look on your face.

"Hello there. May I ask-- Ahh. Well I supose that answers the question of why you were following me. May I join you Padme?"

For a moment you consider keeping up the act but there wouldn't be much point. You rest the tablet on your lap and nod to the seat beside you. "so you noticed me."

"Yes. You were good, but I've been trained to for this kind of thing, and the force gives me an advantage."

"I supose it does." You glance around. No one nearby seems to be paying attention to you. "What are you going to do now that you know I'm here?"

Obi-Wan leans back in his seat, and strokes a hand over his beard. "well, the Council did task myself and Anakin with your protection. I guess I have no choice but to keep an eye on you and make sure nobody else realizes where you are." He looks at you stedy, and full of weight. "do I have your word you will run away from me?"

You straighten your shoulders. "As long as you don't try to box me up for my own good, yes."

He nods, "agreed." glancing up piece stands, straightens his robe, then hesitates and draws his cloak from his shoulders, offering it to you. "The next stop is the temple, shall we?"

You brace yourself with the swaying of the train and rise to stand beside him. "Lets"

You are 90% certain that the figure Obi-Wan was meeting with is Quinlan Vos. It's been less than 12 hours since you saw him last, and he does have a rather distinctive look. Still, you can't be sure. 

You wait until Obi-Wan has disappeared out of sight before slipping into the diner. taking a seat at the bar allows you to watch him in the reflections of the window. He's got a cup of caff in front of him, and seems to be distracted by something on his com.still, you don't know how long he will stay here so you wave off the serving droid rather than order anything.

When the serving droid circles around and asks if he would like a refill you duck your head and do your best not to look like you are watching. You feel an itch on the back of your neck and glance up in time to see him stand and walk directly towards you.

"Now what's a girl like you doing in a place like this," Quinlan asks with one hand on the bar beside you.

You could run. Make a break for the door or pretends to go to the bathroom, but  there's no certainty that you could find Obi-Wan again. This might be your only lead. Besides, he's a Jedi, you're not in any physical danger.

You glance up, a questioning look forming a line between your eyes. "Excuse me?"

Quinlan slips onto the stool next to yours, propping one elbow on the bar and grinning for all he's worth. "Oh come on, you remember me. It hasn't been that long. Thought you were leaving the sector, or is my information behind the times?"

You don't miss the fact that he has actually said your name or anything identifying. "Plans got a little muddled. You know how these things go." You take a risk and add, "sometimes it's better if the problem just sells itself with the higher-ups none the wiser."

He leans back, nods, and looks around with a distance in his gaze. You have just enough time to worry about what he's thinking before he seems to come to a conclusion.

"Perhaps I can help with that." He nodded the door. "The mess that started last night, I have a lead on the whos and hows. If you're interested in coming along and shareing information it might benefit both of us."

That is… Very interesting. You have a few ideas rolling around in the back of your mind but if he already has a lead… You nod.

"This way," You say, taking the lead, a step ahead of R2. Anakin trails a step behind, keeping one hand on the bags and casually scanning the area. You turn walking down passages, scanning your pass when called to. 

You speak to a ticket desk and buy two sentiant tickets and a transport chit for R2. 

Anakin frowns when you reach your gate. "Wait, this is--"

You loop your arm through Anakins. "What was that drink your mother gave us last time? Tsai? Do you think she'd be willing to make it for me again?" Your casual tone is part of the act, but the words are honest. 

Anakin looks down at you with awe and surprise. You pull out your tickets and pass his to him, humming as you step forward and enter the shuttle. 

[[Tattoine->8-2-1]]


:: 8-10-1 {"position":"8425,1950","size":"100,100"}
You grab Anakin's arm and get him to look at you. "Circle around. Get their attention. I'll sneak in over the ridge and get her out." 

You can see it when Anakin focuses on the task at hand. "If you get into trouble. Do you have a flair? There shoud be some on the speeders." You look and find them.

"Will you know when we're away?" You could send up a flair but at that point you wont want attention. 

"I'll know." He squeezes your shoulder then he's racing into the night like a shadow too fast and silent to keep track of.

You brace youself, take a breath, and scramble up the slope. The camp has maybe a dozen low slung tents of tanned hide. There's a herd of banthas penned in against the wall below you. It takes a minute for you to spot Shmi. She's slumped on the sand, a leather contraption wrapped around her. It's attached to a stone a third as large as she is, a millstone maybe or a  some other contraption. Not that it matters. 

Anakin calls out to the east, the sound rippling over the open landscape and bouncing off the hills. A flash of green marks his slowly advancing possition.  A double handfull of warriors come out of tents and set down their tasks, picking up weapons. One of them guestures, hooting in their native language. The others nod and guesture before they all step up to meet him. 

You have to turn away, looking down again. You have your own task. You could try to climb down into the Bantha pen, but if anyone glances up they'll see you. And then there's the animals, the smallest thing could set them off. Going around would be safer but it would take longer.

"Alright, here's what we do. You sneek down there, I'll cover you from the ridge with the rifle. Do we have a set of short range coms?"

"I don't know, but I can modify our coms to work like radios," Anakin clenches his hands and then visibly pulls himself together. You nod and swap your com for the rifle, checking the sights and power pack. You're not a bad shot but this isn't the kind of blaster you're used to. better not to need it. You snatch up a pair of binocs as well and send a thank you to Owen for being so prepaired and generous. 

A minute later Anakin hands you back the com. You clip it to your collar and glance at the slope. "Give me three minutes to get into possition."

Anakin nods. "I'll come in from the east." Then he's gone, slipping into the night. 

It's your turn to climb the slope. You go up on all fours, the rifle straped to your back. It's not hard to find a spot in the shadow of a rock where you can stretch out on your front and see most of the camp. 

The tuskens have set up between two ridges of stone. One opening is clearly biger and more used then the other. The banthas are in a makeshift pen almost directly below you. The tents are set up to close in each side of the canyon, sheltering and hiding the activity within. Shmi is harnesed with her hands bound in front of her, and a large shaped stone at her feet. She's tucked into a curve of the far wall, only one tent between her and the empty desert. 

Well, not so empty at the moment. 

You don't see Anakin until he clicks the com and you know to look for him. He's crouched low, just beyond the light of the camp, mixed in with an old rockfall. 

"I've got you, hold there." You say clicking the com back at him. You switch the scope to night mode and scan the area in front of him. 

"Two tents ahead. People in both of them." He could circle around toward the banthas. It would keep him out of view but he'd be farther from Shmi... Or... You can see a streight path between Anakin and Shmi. He could get to her, but there's no way he wont be seen.

You strap your clothing close to your body, glance around one last time to make sure that no one is looking up and swing your legs over the edge of the cliff. 

It's not a dificult climb, but it's dark and you don't have a rope. Every beat of your heart pushes you to go faster. Every cry from Anakin's direction urges you to move, but you force yourself to test each hold, to dig your feet into the cracks in the rock and test them with your weight. It takes less then ten minutes to scale the thirty or fourty feet, but it feels like a lifetime before you let yourself drop the last two feet to the ground. 

There's no way you'll be able to climb back up that with people after you. Not with and injured woman to protect. 

Holding still you wait for a cry to go up, for one of the bantha to call out. They're restless. One of the big heffers lowers it's head and snorts a warning at you. You keep yourself small, pressed up against the rock, and ease to one side until you bump into the fence. You slip under the bar of the gate and go still again.

The camp isn't still. Childrean and people moving with the stiffness of age are gathering up or tieing down anything that isn't easilly moved. You haven't been noticed yet, but it could happen at any moment.

You slip into the shadow of an empty tent, and wait. The movement of the tuskens is purposeful, organized even if it's hurried. None of them are going near Shmi. 

A group of what can only be teenagers bring a few speeders to the central fire, and hook up a hovercart. Another runs past without noticing you, carying blankets and bantha harnesses slung over one shoulder.

You circle around the ridge, trying to be as fast as you can while maintaining your silence. When you reach the camp it's not as still as you hoped. The young and the elderly have been at work, packing things up and tieing things down, There's a speeder with a hovercart in the center of camp, already half loaded. Another figure leads the first of the banthas out of the pen. 

When you manage to spot Shmi you let out a relieved breath. She hasn't been moved yet, still bound to the millstone, head bent.

You slide to one knee in the sand. Shmi looks up, mouth open. A slach seperates her from the stone, harnes still binding her chest and hands. 

You spin, snarling. The tusken, coming at you is small, little more then a child but they have a blade at the ready. 

You slash the air beteen you, showing your teeth in a snarl. Another tusken grabs the first, pulling them back.

"Go, around the ridge," you say over your shoulder. "Shmi struggles and after a few seconds manages to stand. She's hunched over, knees bent as she steps away. You circle, keeping yourself between Shmi and the tuskens, but you're small and clearly a woman. 

At the edge of the tents, one of them come in from your left side, staff high. You catch the staff twisting with the movement. even with that single touch you can tell the other fighter is stronger and hevier. Anakin is away across the sand. Shmi can't move fast, not on her own.

"I'm here with Anakin. We're getting you out of here," you whisper. 

"Oh force," She manages to say, but there's no time for talk. A moment later she's free of the stone. You cut the bindings on her hands as she keeps an eye out. So far so good.

"West, around the ridge."

Shmi nods.

The camp is maybe fifty steps back when a new call goes up. Have you been spotted? You can't be sure. 

"There," Shmi gasps, nodding to a cleft in the rock. The two of you might be able to squuze in, and stay hidden. Unless you have been seen, then you're only trapping yourselves.

You turn back to the bantha pen. It's a moduler thing, easilly moved. There are pegs to keep the main poles in place, braced against each other so even when the Banthas rub against them they stay strong... from the inside. 

You lean back on one foot, test your balance in the sand and kick out with your heel. The suport shaft shifts. The banthas in the pen turn and grumble. Another kick knocks the bar away compleatly. You dart to the next.  

Someone fires a blaster in the distance. Closer, someone shouts. You only think to duck after a bolt flickers over your head. A thiner tusken with an older blaster. They try to fire again, slap the side of the weapon when nothing happens. 

You feel the heat of the shot through the sand, blinded as the blaster finally goes off. No pain, not hit. Something big moves beside you. A crack as the fence gives way. The banthas are running plowing through the weak spot in the fence. 

You scurry in the other direction, head down, trying to coax your sight back. 

Blobs of light and shadow slowly turn into chaos. Bantha's running over tents. The tuskens who remained behind trying to coax and settle their beasts, as the first sparks of fire latch onto anything that will burn. 

Shmi. You have to get to Shmi. You dart forward, moving when you can. Trying always to get cloaser to the last place you saw her. A flair goes off over your head. A bantha bellows. A tent is pulled sideways, trailing straps tangled up in a speeder. 

There. Shmi is still bound to her millstone, sheltering behind it as much as she can. Head down and half burried in the sand. You slide into place next to her, fumbling for your knife, going for the straps even as she blinks up at you in shock and confusion.

"West, around the ridge." you say as the final stap comes loose. 

She doesn't ask questions. You're close enough to the edge of the camp. Shmi stumbles at first before you catch her arm and haul it over your shoulder. 

The camp is maybe fifty steps back when a new call goes up. Have you been spotted? you can't be sure in the dark and confusion.

Shmi flinches back from their touch. Then tries to run when the strap comes loose, only to be yanked off her feet when the tusken stomps on a trailing chord. 
(set: $risk to it+1)
No time left. You move. 

A running step and you're between Shmi and the enemy. A sweeping slash cuts apart the chord. The tusken draws a staff from their shoulder, and raises it, calling for the rest of their clan. You only have a moment to act before you're surounded and outnumbered.

You catch your arm around her as the next shot goes wide. Getting back to the speeder is a blur and you know you've left a trail that anyone could follow. 

You snatch up the spare blaster, press a water skin into Shmi's hand and set yourself up to snipe at anyone who gets too close. 

Eventually Anakin comes around the ridge, and the few remaining tuskens flee. Only then do you slump back and see the results. 

Shmi is slumped against a rock. The flask has fallen from her hand. There's a dark patch on her side wher blood as seeped out through the thin faric of her shirt... The blaster shot...

You know she's dead before Anakin takes her hand and checks her pulse. 

"She's gone," he says, voice utterly hollow.

"She was shot while we were running. I thought she was okay." You hadn't had time to think, not really. She hadn't said anything but of course she woudn't. She'd been out here abused and worked near to death for days. Of course she wasn't alright.

Sounds cross outside. The low bellows of Banthas. The occasional shot of a blaster rifle. Someone shouts. You hear footsteps and heavy breathing as someone jogs past outside your hiding spot. 

You desperatly think of Anakin, trying to send him the knowledge that you have Shmi and you're both alive, at least for the moment. Shmi's hand relaxes in yours, and your heart thunders fearing the worst. Do you try to make it back to the speeders or keep hiding?

"Just a little further--" 

You settle Shmi onto the sand, put a blaster and a cantine of water in her hand.

"I'm going to cover our tracks. Anakin should be coming soon."

You untie one of your scarves and let it trail over the sand behind you. You're nearly back to the crack in the rock a cry comes from above you. A shot ripples over your shoulder. You crouch and dive for the nearest cover. 

The area is littered with stones and you dart between them, trying to pull any persuit away from Shmi and the speeders. 

Slowly the night quiets again. 

You wait as long as you dare before making your way back to the speeders.

You wait until a touch of light is in the sky before finally hearing Anakin's call You slip out of the rocks, scraping your hands and knees, and not caring for the relief of it. You see Anakin up on a rock, scanning the area and wave to get his attention.
(if: $risk >1 )[
Turning back you pause. Shmi hasn't come out of the crack in the rock. 

You reach in, and tug at her sleave. She doesn't move.

"Padme?" Anakin asks, stepping up behind you.

"We hid in here, but now Shmi isn't..."

Anakin frowns, then nudges you out of the way and holds up a hand. He carefuly levitates Shmi out of the crevice. She's still and silent, her skin too pale under the dust. A sqirpion drops to the sand and Anakin steps on it. The crunch is too loud in the open silence. 

"We were hiding..." You say again but it's distant in your own ears. 

"She's dead, and you didn't even notice."

You flinch because he's right, no mater your intentions. 

He picks her up, turns away. 

The ride back to the Lars farm is as quiet as Shmi's cooling form.

"Is that really Ani?" Shmi says. She's pale and shaky on her feet, shivering in the night air, but she's smiling. 

Anakin sees tht you're not alone and races forward, barely managing to stop himself before running into both of you. His hands hover over Shmi scanning her form before pulling her into his arms.

"Mom, Force, Mom," He gasps and there are tears in his eyes.

"Ani. I knew I'd see you again."

You step back, giving them the illusion of privacy. Eventually you all head back to the speeders and Shmi climbs up in front of Anakin for the way back.

You squeeze Shmi's hand, still trying to be as quiet as you can when you ease from the rock. The moon is out, and bright enough to see by even if you can't make out any details. You slowly scan the area, looking for movement...

Nothing, but that doesn't mean nothing's there.

Shmi is shaking as she comes out of the rock. Her hand is dry. The moment she's no longer supported by the stone she colapses. 

"Shmi, Shmi!" you sake her shoulder, keeping your voice a low whisper despite how much you want to call for help.

She stirs, blinks up at you. Alive, but she needs help.

You lever her up, suporting as much of her weight as you can. The speeders aren't far. You have to believe that it will be enough. 

You've never felt as relieved as when you see the rock where you left the speeders, only for it to be doubled when Anakin pokes his head out and spots you.

"Oh thank the force," you breathe as he comes and takes her from you.

"Thank the force," he echoes. Then, "She needs water." 

You take a few minutes giving Shmi what care you can, but you also need to get going before dawn turns the desert into a frying pan. After maybe half an hour you ease Shmi onto a speeder in front of Anakin and slip away into the night.

The moon is high in the sky give you enough light to tace your way back. You smell smoke before you see the speeder and something in you fears teh worst. 

The speeders have been shot. One of them is leaking fluid onto the sand. Shmi is proped up against a rock, the blaster has fallen from her hand. There's a trickle of dark blood dripping from the corner of her mouth, and two dark patches on the front of her shirt. Anakin is kneeling beside her. Her limp hand clutched between his. 

You slump to the ground across from him, aorrow a hollow weight in your chest.

"They found her. She got out and then they found her and shot her before I could get back," Anakin says.

"I was trying to cover our tracks." You know it's not the right thing to say the moment it's out of your mouth. Anakin's eyes are colder then you've ever seen them, colorless, almost yellow in the light of the moon. 

"She's dead because you didn't stay with her."

You flinch because he's right, no mater your intentions. 

He picks her up, turns away. 

The ride back to the Lars farm is as quiet as Shmi's cooling form.

The moon is high in the sky give you enough light to tace your way back. There's something in the air when you get close, a movement or a presence. Then you enter the hiding spot and Anakin looks up at you with a greatful smile. He's holding the water flask for his mother, who is at least awake even if she still needs a lot of care. 

Anakin finds your hand and squeezes it. "Thank you," he mouths. 

You nod, and give them as much privacy as you can in the small space.

When she is a bit stronger and the night is nearly done you mount up on the speeders and slip away into the dawn.

"You can circle the tents to the south, by the bantha pen."

"Roger," Anakin answers. 

He turns in that direction. You watch him slip up behind one of the tents and go still. A figure passes. He darts to the next tent. 

You have to lean forward to see Anakin when he reaches the Bantha pen. They start to shift and one of them tosses their head, but Anakin reaches in past the stakes and they settle down. You let out a breath.

"You know," Anakin says, "I could set these banthas loose..."

That's an idea... but is it too dangerous? Would Shmi be in danger?

"Between the tents, I'll signal you."

He doesn't answer, just steps forward, hidden in the shadows. A tusken is standing in front of their tent, casually leaning back and sipping at a flask. They could go inside any moment, or stroll away... 

You wait one minute, two. They don't move. 

There's no heat signiture in the tent behind them. The thought comes up that you could trank them, let them fal back. If Anakin flipped the tent flap over them no one would know...

You bite your lip, knowing the risk. 

"I'm getting her out of there." Anakin says, scratchy but still determined through the com. 

"I'll cover you," it's all you can say before he's up and moving. 

Anakin is so fast, it's hard to keep track of him even when you know where he's going. He darts past the last of the tents, coming to a stop over Shmi. A cry goes out, and a wave of tuskens reach for their weapons. Anakin's lightsaber comes on, flicking through the air. The straps around Shmi fall away like ribbons. 

He brings the saber up to a high guard, and you bite your lip as you sight on the first tusken rushing forward. 

You pull the trigger. 

Again and again you pull the trigger as Anakin's lightsaber flashes below you. It's a bloody mess. You try to tell yourself it's worth it when Anakin helps Shmi back around the ridge, but is it really?

You nod to Shmi, and the three of you get out of there as fast as you can, leaving a masacer in your wake.

"Can you aim them back east?" Shmi is on the oposite side of the camp, it should be as safe as any of this mess. 

"Will do."

You watch Anakin's back as he does something to the pen. A minute later, he's pressing himself to the stone wall, the Banthas snorting and calling One large bull lowers it's head and shoulders aside the fence, calling the rest of the herd around him. 

The tuskens jump to, some rushing forward trying to calm and corral. Others run ahead trying to block the mouth of the canyon. In the chaos no one notices Anakin slipping east, around the back of the camp. You're the only one to see him cut Shmi loose and help her up, puling her away into the dark. 

Crawling back a few feet, you slip away down the ridge. 

Several minutes later Anakin and Shmi join you at the speeders. You clutch Shmi's hand, but there isn't time for a proper greeting. Shmi is in bad shape and as soon as the Tuskens figure out what happened they'll come looking for her. 

Anakin settles Shmi in front of him, and you start off across the sands, back to safety.

Anakin circles the central cookfire area, staying clear of the main paths. He's so close. Pinned behind a tent as two figures crouch in the sand talking. If he could just get past them he'd be at Shmi's side.

You had forgotten the sheer physicality of Tattoine. Mos Espa is as barren and dry as you remember but somehow time had dulled the reality of it. The moment you land the air tastes different. You step down onto the dry packed ground and falter when the wave of raw heat hits you. Your mouth goes dry and your eyes start to water when the wind suddenly turns, peppering grit against any scrap of bare skin. 

Anakin braces your shoulder and steps to one side, guiding you into the shade. "Try covering your face." he guestures to the scarf covering your hair. You're wearing your plainest, blandest handmaiden garb and yet he seems to fit in far better in his undyed jedi robes, then you do. 

You take a moment to aclimate, using your scarf to block the wind. The other passengers are all wnadering off in verious directions. Unlike Correlia there's no spaceport her, just a strech of fenced off land that's patrolled by the ocasional droid.

"I supose we should get going," you say after a moment. except, now that you're here, you're not sure what to do next. You look up at Anakin.

"I'm not sure where my mom would be. We could check Watto's if it's still around, or we could ask the slaves, they tend to keep track of who gets sold off in case family comes looking, and... We shouldn't go walking around with these bags. We might need a speeder or a shuttle, but it wont be cheap."

That at least, you are prepaired for. When you decided to change destinations you also remembered to get a mix of currency, you won't be stuck like you were last time.

Anakin is still looking out at the planet, so it seems to be up to you to choose what to tackle first.

You glance around one last time.

"Be ready," you whisper into your com. Breathe out. Pull the trigger. The flash of the bolt leaves a shadow in your vision and you duck down in case anyone was looking in your direction. 

There's shuffling over the com. Anakin, breathing heavy, then silence. You count to ten before slowly lifting your head again. There's movement in the camp, but no panic. 

You spend a moment locating Anakin again. He's moved forward, pinned behind a tent as two figures crouch in the sand talking. If he could just get past them he'd be at Shmi's side.

Below you, Anakin starts to shift.

"Not yet," you whisper. Anakin makes a low sound, then settles back. 

You wait. Still as the sand around you. 

After nearly ten minutes the tusken raises a hand and moves off towards the fire. 

You relax a fraction. Through the com, you hear Anakin let out a breath. 

"Go," you whisper, and he does.

[[nearly there->8-19-2]]

"I'll give you an opening. Move fast." You swallow and take your skope off Anakin. He'll be fine. Shmi will be okay. You trust him. 

You focus your shot on the central cookfire with the big pot settled over it. The whole time you've been watching the fire had been tended by someone, people coming and going, traiding off. At the moment there's a figure with broad shoulders standing by the pot. A smaller figure is sitting nearby watching over a pair of smaller figures. 

You take aim, take a breath, pull the trigger.

The cooking pot explodes, spilling water and grease over the coals. They flair up briefly before being doused. The figure by the fire hoots in pain. The other figure grabs the little ones. Tent flaps are thrown open. guards turn to look. The tribe as a whole pulling inwards. 

You stay perfectly still for a long minute. When you finally look back at where Shmi was bound, there's no sign on her. 

You let out another breath before crawling back a few feet and slipping away down the ridge. 

several minutes later Anakin and Shmi join you at the speeders. You clutch Shmi's hand, but there isn't time for a proper greeting. Shmi is in bad shape and as soon as the Tuskens figure out what happened they'll come looking for her.

"Hold," you say, and below you Anakin goes still. 

You wait, tense as a wire with Anakin's breath in your ear. One of the tuskans lifts a hand, then lets it fall. A few minutes pass. Another tusken crosses and enters the tent Anakin is hiding beside.

You don't see what causes it, but a call goes up from inside the tent. The two sitting figures look up, then go to investigate. 

"Now," you say and Anakin is moving almost before you're done. A flick of his blade, and he has Shmi free of her bonds. You draw your gaze back, scanning for anyone who might have noticed. 

Before you can send a warning or start shooting someone cries out. They've been seen. 

"Anakin, get out of there," You don't know if he hears you. His lightsaber is out, flashing through the air. The tuskens come out of their tents, hooting, brandishing weapons. 

You're his backup. Something inside you revolts at the idea, but you start shooting, trying to help clear a path for them to get out. 

Later you slip down the hill and meet them at the speeders. You nod without saying a word as before mounting up and riding out across the desert.

<!--Watto's shop-->
You roughly remember the way to Watto's junk shop and once your destination becomes clear Anakin starts guiding you. You see the Toydarian before he sees you. There are a pair of pit droids chattering at him as he tries to do something to a powered down droid. He curses at them in huttese and the pit droids back up, powering down around him. You can't help but notice the added age in his features. The way he's sitting rather then buzzing about like in your memories. 

Anakin steps forward, eyes on the droid in his hands. "Ding mi chasa hopa." 

Watto snaps back at him, still in huttese  "Ke booda? Yo baan pee hota. No wega
mi condorta. Kin chasa du Jedi. No bata tu tu." He grabs for the droid but Anakin effortlessly lifts it away twisting a few wires, and tightening a screw. 

"I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker." You are silently greatful when Anakin switches back to basic. Your huttese is nearly non-existant. 

Watto squints at Anakin, then over at you. Then all at once realization comes over his features. "Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaah!!"

The bundle in Anakin's hands suddenly comes to life, beeping and moving a pair of grabbers.  You and Watto both blink at in surprise. 

"You are Annie! It is you! Ya sure sprouted! Weehoo! A Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe you couldda help wit some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money..." He laughs and manages to buzz up a foot or two.

Anakin kneels to put the little droid on the ground before turning back to Watto "My mother..."

Watto turns over a hand, "Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine no more. I sold her."

"Sold her..." Anakin's voice is slightly hollow. You both knew it was possible likely even, if his dreams were true...

Watto's tone turns consoling "Years ago. Sorry, Annie, but you know, business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that?"

Anakin closes his eyes and you recognise the meditative breathing. "Do you know where they are?"

"Long way from here... someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think..." Watto scrattches his side scanning the area in front of his shop. 

"I'd like to know." this time Anakin's tone is firm. toydaarians may not be suseptible to mind tricks but he gets the hint. 

"Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's go look in my records."

You step inside and the cool of the stone is a relief after the pelting sun. Anakin and Watto go through the records on a dusty access box until finally you have the cordinates for a small moisture farm. 

You take Anakin's hand as you step outside. He squeezes your hand.

"Would you be alright, going to the slave quarters?" You rest a hand on his arm. He takes a breath and you can see the Jedi training in action as he relaxes.

"It'll bring back memories, but I'll be okay."

You pay a few credits for space in a storage room, and leave R2 to guard your things before heading into the city.

R2 is happy enough to stay with the ship keeping an eye on it and your bags. You take Anakin's arm as you head into the city.

Even with the heat, people are out in the streets, Jawas hawking droid parts, slaves running errands, farmers loading or unloading their wares. You catch the smell of roasting meat and trade two credits for something on a stick. Anakin never leaves your side, eyes constantly scanning. Every so often he'll stop and look at something, a building here, a sign there. Each time it happens tension tries to creep into his shoulders again before he makes himself relax. 

The slave quarters are as busy as the rest of the city, but the feel of the place is different. You no longer blend in. You cross an invisible boundry and there are eyes on you. Children without shoes scuttle out of your way. The people around the well, and gathered in doorways pause their conversation as you pass. 

Anakin's steps slow, he hesitates, until he comes to a stop in a small square between buildings.

"My friend Kitster lived there." His voice was hollow. 

The buildings all look the same to you, but you beieve him a the same.

"Let's find a ship, I bet you could spot one that's actually worth what I'm going to pay for it."

Anakin glances at you and refocuses, a smile tugging at his lips. "Well, if you insist," he says and together you head down the line of hangers. Every third one seems to have a junker under a tarp in a back corner. Anakin shook his head at the first few. He spoke to a man in huttese about another.  He took a likeing to U-wing before telling the seller off when he found rust peppering the hull. A dugg tried to sell him a shell of a ship without a power core. 

It took a few hours but eventually Anakin finished haggling with a woman over the HWK-290 sitting in a back corner of her lot. You carefuly count out the coin, as if every one could be the differnce. 

The ship is named the Stalwart and it seems to fit. The inside is bare bones, covered in dust, and grit but when Anakin gets behind the wheel, and powers her up, he nods, satisfied. Of course he then insists on tinkering around for another two hours while you and R2 clean up the space you're going to be living in.

Anakin eventually returns from the bowels of the ship, sleaves rolled up to his elbows and streeks of grease on his hands.  He seems more content then you've yet seen him, certainly the happiest he's been since you arrived.

Anakin nodded. "This girl has a hyperdrive, she can do orbital without a problem."

"Then let's go tonight, if you don't think it would be rude."

"Oh, my... Oh, my maker! Master Anakin! I knew you would return, I knew you would! And this must be Miss Padmé." C-3P0 says once he recognises you. "Oh, my circuits! I'm so pleased to see you both!"

You find Anakin's hand and step forward. He stays a step back as you step up onto the stoop and knock on the door. A Twilek woman answers. Her green skin is dark from the sun. Her hand on the knob is worn and callosed and scared from years of work. 

You smile. "Hello, I'm sorry to disturb you. My name is Padme and this is my friend Anakin. He grew up around here and his friend used to live here. Do you know what might have happened to them? It would have been in the last ten years. Anakin, what was their name again?"

"Kitster Banai," Anakin says. His voice is stronger but there's still a wealth of emotion hidden under the words, something waiting to for a crack, a weakness to pour fourth. 

The Twilek looks between the two of you, then shakes her head. "Only got here two years ago. Never met them." They hesitate, then tilts her head down the road. "You might ask Old lady Nebbin four doors down."

You nod. "Thank you for the information." She shuts the door before you can offer or ask anything more. 

Turning back to Anakin you wait for him to look at you. "Lady Nebbin might be able to tell us about your mother as well. Would you like to go talk to her?"

Anakin visibly pulls himself together. He breathes, then nods. Is it this place that is affecting him this deeply? or is it facing what he left behind?

The old woman sits on the edge of a wall, a bowl in her lap. She has a stack of wiry reeds by her side. She picks them up one at a time, pealing back the outer layers, collecting the fibers. She looks up when you draw closer, and you can see the years heavy in her eyes. 

Her hands never stop moving as she speaks. "What are you looking for here?" words are brusque but not harsh.

You hesitate, and glance at Anakin. He seems to have a bit more control. Before you can get in the middle of things he steps forward and bows his head to her.

"Grandmother, I am looking for someone, if you would help guide my steps." he turns, drawing is padded one braid up away from his neck and tugging down his collar to show a thin white scar.

The woman's hands slow, and then still. She sets aside her bowl. "Who are you looking for? I will tell you if I can."

It takes Anakin a moment to speak. He opens his mouth, licks his lips and then closes it again. At last, in a choked out voice he says, "my mother,Shmi Skywalker."

The woman nods with all the solemnity of a benediction. Briefly she glances at you, but then seems to decide you're not important. She closes her eyes, raises a hand and after a moment speaks. "Shmi Skywalker worked at one of the junk shops. Its fortunes started to fade. She had a difficult time, but luck was with her. She caught the eye of a moisture farmer. He purchased her freedom and took her to wife. His name was…" She pauses, lips pursed "Lars, that was it. Don't know where his farm is, but that should get you started." She nods and moves to pick up our bowl again.

"Thank you grandmother, is there any thing I can do to repay this kindness?"

"A bit of conversation is enough. The rains water all crops."

You are briefly introduced to Owen and Beru before they ushure you into a makeshift sick room. Clieg Lars is proped up in bed, the stump of his leg bandaged and propped up on a pillow. His eyes show the pain he's in, but his words are clear. 

"So you're Anakin, a proper jedi. You'll excuse me for jumping to the point but are you here because of Shmi?"

Anakin's jaw tightens and he nods once, sharply. "What happened?"

"It was just before dawn few days back. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusken Raiders. Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators. From the tracks, she was about halfway home when they took her.
Those Tuskens walk like men, but they're vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. I'd be with them, only... after I lost my leg I just couldn't ride any more... until I heal."

"Where?" Anakin asks and you can feel the weight of his presence in that single word."

"East of here, in the crags." Clieg grabs Anakin's hand before he can turn away. "Is she still alive?"

Anakin nods again. "I can feel her." Then in a swirl of robes he's crossing the inner courtyard.

Owen runs after him, calling "Take my speeder, It's in the shed." He dodges ahead of them, slapping at the door to the shed until is slides open. 

You catch up to Anakin a moment later. He glances down at you, hope and fear and desperation chacing over his features. 

"You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padmé. You'll be safe."

"Anakin..." You know he's right. You know that he can hande himself. You know you haven't been properly trained for something like this, but...

[[go with him->8-7-1]]

You clench your fists. When Owen steps up beside you, you take the speeder before Anakin can reach for it. 

"I'm coming with you."

"Padme," Anakin's voice is stern but there's a waver at the end. 

"No. I'm coming. You need someone to watch your back, and besides You promiced to protect me. If you try to eave me behind I'll just come after you, and that will be even more dangerous."

Anakin meets your gaze for another long minute, but you hold firm. At last he looks away, glancing at Owen.

"Do you have a second speeder?"

Owen nods, and runs to fetch it. Soon you and Anakin are szipping over the sand. You stay in Anakin's wake, sheltered from the wind and the worst of the kicked up sand. You slide between dunes, passing the broken camp and the picked over bodies of the other farmers who went out with Clieg. A ridge of rock shimmers into place in the distance. It grows as Anakin turns in that direction. The striped stone of the ridge rises in a jagged slope that Anakin weaves through as if he was born to it, only slowing so you have a chance to keep up. 

The evening has set in and the temprature has started to drop when Anakin looks up and slows. He gestures for you to be silent staying as low as the speeders will allow. 

"I can sense people over that ridge." Anakin whispers into your hair. "I'm going to check it out."

You shiver, tucked into the rocks as you wait for him to return. It seems to take forever, but at last Anakin's silluette reapears. He waves and guestures that it's safe. You still look around as you step into the open. 

"They have her. They harnesed her like an animal," He's practically spitting, rage trying making him pace, his fists clenched. Even so his voice stays low.

You catch his arm on the next pass. "She's alive. We will not leave without her. Now details; is she guarded. Is she injured?

"I-- I don't know. She feels weak. She... she might not be able to walk. They took her shoes, and her feet were--"

You nod, mentally prepairing for the worst. "Guards?"

"Two, but they were distracted, talking. She was near the center of the camp, so anyone in camp could be there in moments."

"Alright." You consider the situation. Anakin would probably be better at coming up with a strategy but he's too close to this, not thinking clearly. You don't know how many tuskens are over the ridge or how long you have before they notice you.

You could always cause a distraction. Let anakin challenge them, while you sneak in and try to get Shmi out, but if she really can't walk, if somone sees you and calls out-- Or you could stay on the ridge. Let Anakin go in and try to sneak Shmi out. There's a rifle on the speeder. You're a good enough shot to cover Anakin if they do notice, assuming he isn't surounded or surprised or called out. 

If only you had more time, but Shmi needs you now--

Owen and Beru are kind. They invite you inside. You share the ship's water with them, and they share the small tart fruits they grow in an underground greenhouse.

<!--Naboo romance-->
You catch the shuttle to Naboo. You arrive in Theed. Queen Jamilla grants you an audience. The meeting is short, and to the point even with the concern she shows. She grants you use of the lake house, and you pile back into a shuttle for another sub-orbital jump. Then you transfer the bags to a hovercar and finally, finally arrive. 

Dusk rolls over the lake house. The wide manicured garden is blooming with hydrangas and perywinkle. There are a few birds still calling from down by the water and a few crickets have started their evening song. The wind picks up, dancing through a set of chimes, as you let the security system read your hand print and set your bag down in the entryway. 

The house could fit half a dozen but it manages not to feel too large for just the two of you. Three when R2 rolls past and plugs themself into an access port. There's a kitchen that lets out onto a raised deck. The three bedrooms, each have a different and lovely view, one of the lake, one of the rolling hills and one of the garden. There's a coms room tucked into a corner, a more open entertainment space, a common room with plenty of comfortabe seating. 

You've been here before a few times, but this feels different. You are well aware that apart from a daily droid shipment of supplies, you're going to be alone with Anakin until the Jedi or the Chancellor decide the threat has passed. 

"So would you like to rest or..." Anakin asks. (if: $romantic)[You hear the question he's really asking, which room are you going to take, and will he be allowed in?

You could stay up for a bit, check your coms... Let Dorme and the others know that you arrived safely. You consider it breafly, and then yawn. Even if you never really got on Coruscant time, the hyperspace lag is all too real. One night of proper sleep wont hurt.

You go to bed with Anakin, exploring each other until you end up falling asleep in each others arms.

Some time later a shift beside you and a chill makes you blink awake. Anakin has rolled away from you, the sheets tangled around his legs. He's mumbling in his sleep, bad dreems. You don't know if it would be better to wake him or if it's something to do with the force.

You wish Anakin a good night and slip into your room. 

Some time later when the moon sweeps silver through the window you turn over and come awake. Your door has swung open and R2 is wobbling in the doorway. It spins to look at you, then away, then back. 

A rush of fear thrums in your veigns. Another attack? you thought you were safe, but it's not impossible that someone followed you. You slip out of bed, not making a sound as you step towards R2 on bare feet. 

R2 blinks a few lights at you before rolling over to Anakin's door. It's open a crack and you can hear his distress. Half cut off words as he tosses back and fourth. You take a half step forward. Would it be an invasion to wake him?

You straddle his lap, wraping your arms around his shoulders.

"Yeah?" 
(if:$anakinSex is false)[
He bites his lip. "I want to, but... I've never..." 

"That's okay. Do you have protection?"

He nods, on more solid ground. "I got a clip about a year ago for a mission, so I'm good there."

"Good, me too." you slide a hand down his chest until you reach the edge of his trunks. "May  I?"

"Yeah."

Anakin lifts his hips so you can push his suit aside. Curling your hand around him, you at his cock until it fills out. You have to shuffle a bit to get your own suit out of the way, and thank the force you chose to wear a two piece. 

You slide down onto his dick, letting your head fa back as you let out a breath. The heat of him inside you is a lovely contrast to the slight chill of the water. Anakin makes a bitten off sound and rocks his hips up, hitting a spot inside you that makes your blood sing. 

You're both a little too desperate, a little too hungry. His hands find their way up to your breasts. You pant and place kisses against his neck. It's over too fast leaving your breathless and boneless, the water doing most of the work to hold you up.

You grin stupidly at him.

"Force I love you," he says into your hair.

Later, you drag yourself to the shore, laying in the sun until hunger lures you back up to the house.

You press yourself against his side, the heat of his skin a warm lane contrasting the cool water. He sips an arm around your back. 

"You don't like swiming?" you ask. Your tone is light, just an stray thought. 

"It took me a long time to learn." He runs a hand through the water, creating ripples with his fingers. "I'd never seen a pool before I got to the temple. The idea of that much water, just sitting around, and people moving in it, messing it up so it wasn't good to drink, salt and clhorine. I didn't have a panic attack, but I couldn't do it. Obi-Wan and his friend Bant had to work with me slowly aclimating me to it. Bathtubs and then ponds." he shakes his head. "I'm fine with it now. I can swim, i just... There's aways that little part of me that sees this and can't believe it." he waves a hand at the lake and the shore and the sky."

You hum. "It's beautiful. Sometimes people forget that. Even I forget it sometimes." You let your head rest on his shoulder.

"This must be normal to you," he muses.

"Yes. My sisters and my cousins would go swimming all the time. In the summer we'd take trips to the lake country or to the equator islands. Even our history and stories are full of water."

"Really? will you tell me one?"

There sitting int he shallows you tell him the story of Nawlie and the flood. How the child saw the rising water and found a shell to make into a boat. Later you sit on the shore in a pair of lounge chairs and listen to him tell the story of Tsai, and why each blend is a little different. When the sun is hanging low in the sky you walk back up to the house, hands twined together.

"Come on. There's another outlook point a little farther on. It has an amazing view." You turn and hurry up the path before he can make anything out of it. 

The hike is gentle but not short and the sun is dipping towards the hills when you make it back to the house.

You glance at him. His eyes are still dark and his his breathing unsteady. "I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own."

You look down, then glance back at him before finally turning towards the rest of the path. "Shall we continue?"

He nods and niether of you bring it up again as you slowly walk along the lake. The hike is gentle but not short and the sun is dipping towards the hills when you make it back to the house.

You lean into the kiss. The way his hands are tracing over your arms and back are making you lightheaded.

"Anakin," you gasp when he moves to push you up agianst the banister. "Anyone coud see."

He growls, and pulls back enough to let his head fall forward, resting against your own. "Let them. I don't care. Love isn't shamefull"

"No," you agree, "but it can't get back to the council, or the senate. If we were back at the house..."

He closes his eyes and when he opens them he seems to have more control of himself. He steps back, giving you room while still holding your hand. 

"When we get back to the house," he says, and kisses the back of your hand.

The hike is gentle but not short and you get distracted more then once, despite the danger.  The sun is dipping towards the hills when you make it back to the house.

"What, no, I just... want to know more about you." 

You bite your lip. His sputtering is adorable. "I'll tell you if you tell me."

He blinks, "What, my first crush?" You nod. "Okay, but you first."

"All right... I was twelve. His name was Palo. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes." you play it up, still teasing him. He rolls his eyes and shuffles in his seat. "Your turn."

He looks at you and there's a moment where you are intensely aware of his gaze, the breeze on your skin, the grass tickling your legs. 

"You."

He leans forward, tipping you back in the grass until he's leaning over you, hair glittering in the sunlight. I was there in that junk shop every day.  Every day worn out moisture farmers and jaded slaves came in and haggled for the smallest scrap. Then you walked in an your eyes lit up at all the little odds and ends. You saw the world like I did, full of wonder and posibuility and you didn't have to fight every step of the way.

"You asked if I was an angel." your voice is distant.

"You said no, but I still think that was a lie."

You duck your head. It's flattering even if you don't want anything with him right now. 

The hint of a shadow falls over you, and you glance up to see one of the shaak has wondered over.

"Well hello, what are you?" Anakin asks, holding a hand out to it. It sniffs at his fingers.

You take a breath. "All right... I was twelve. His name was Palo. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes." Okay maybe you're teasing him a little, playing things up, even if it is the truth.

"All right, I get the picture..." Anakin's posture streightens, going back to his jedi training briefly before an a calmer voice, "whatever happened to him?"

"I went into public service. He went on to become an artist." You have one of his paintings. He's not bad, but not someone you'd want to date now that you're a little older.

"Maybe he was the smart one."

You're not sure what he means...

[[because of the politics->9-15-1]]
[[because of the assassination attempts->9-15-2]]


:: 9-15-1 {"position":"10300,2100","size":"100,100"}
"The politics?"

He jerks his chin more then nods.

"You really don't like politicians, do you?"

"I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them." He smiles to soften the blow. "I don't think the system works."

It's not an uncommon statement. You've through the same thing plenty of times, often after fighting yout way through a wall of flimsywork. In school you often debated the merits of different governing systems.

"How would you have it work?" you ask, curous what the Jedi order might teach. 

"We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it."

He sounds so earnest, but... "That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't always agree. In fact, they hardly ever do."

"Then they should be made to." There's a steel under his words. Maybe that's his experience. Jedi are often the final arbitrator when local parties can no longer think or act without pregedice... Still...

"By whom? Who's going to make them?"

"I don't know. Someone."

"You?"

"Of course not me."

"But someone."

"Someone wise."

"That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me." your words are sharp. Naboo has an elected monarchy and studying your own history has shown how bad that can go in only a few years."

The corner of his mouth tugs up, "Well, if it works..." he only holds out for another minute before his mask slips and the grin shows through. 

"You're making fun of me!" you almost can't believe it. 

"Oh no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator."he says with sarcasum practically dripping off his words. 

"You're so bad!" You lift a hand, knocking it into the picknick basket. before you can think better of it you snatch a small plum out of the basket and throw it at his head. He catches it and raises an eyebrow. You snatch up another piece of fruit and another throwing them at him until he has to use the force to stop them. He loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. You burst into laughter, nearly doubled over, as Anakin sprawls out dramatically. 

You look up when a Shaak, ponders closer, sniffing at the bounty around Anakin.

"Well hello, what are you?" Anakin asks, holding a hand out to it.

"You actually try to do your job. You shouldn't be getting any."

"It's becasue I do my job that I get them." 

He doesn't look happy but he doesn't immeditly respond body stiff and hands clenched in his lap. 

You lean forward covering his hand with yours. "Besides, if I hadn't become queen we wouldn't have met."

The stiffness eases out of his shoulders. He manages to smile as he looks at you, then he goes still, looking over your shoulder. 

You glance up. One of the shaaks has wandered over and is sniffing at the picnic basket.

You stand up and flutter your hands at the shaak until it snorts and turns back to it's herd. when you look back Anakin is sitting there looking up at you with wide silly smile like you hung the stars or possibly squashed a spider for him.

"Protecting me?" he asks.

"Only from your own foolishness. Shaaks are about as smart as rocks. It would eat your hair off your head if it thought it tasted good. How could you possibly explain being half bald when you went back to the temple?

You spread imaginary skirts in a curtsy. "Accepted, but only if you will join me in sampling the chilled leamon soda in my pack."

"It would be an honor."

You flop back down beside him, and Anakin pulls out a pair of glasses from the picknic basket. You spend the rest of the afternoontalking about nothing with the shaak wandering around you and the spray from the waterfall drifting past to dampen the heat of the day. Eventually you pack things up and Anakin offers motions for you to lead as you make your way back to the house. 

[[Evening->9-8-1]]

You lean back. Shaak are large but harmless. They're herbavours and they don't even panic or stampede like cows or bantha. 

Anakin sits up, still holding a hand out to the shaak. Then you see his expression and bite your lip. In a single fluid move he stands and lauches himself up onto the back of the shaak. It bellows in surprise and starts to spin back to it's herd. Anakin ends up sitting backwards on the creature.

Stumbling to your feet you chace after Anakin. You don't know if you should be laughing or worried. At least Anakin doesn't seem concerned. He pushes himself up, and for a moment he stands on the creatures back before it stumbles, weak little legs giving out under it. 

Anakin falls to the grass in a heap. You don't try to stop the bubble of laughter the rises up and breaks free of your chest. The shaak shakes itself and ambles away unconcerned now that there's nothing on it's back. 

Except... Anakin hasn't gotten up. You hesitate, then rush forward. "Annie, Annie! Are you all right?" You fall to your knees next to him, tugging at his robe until he turns over... He makes a stupid rediculous face at you. Your mouth hangs open for a moment before you pull yourself together and slap his shoulder. He goes to catch your arm, and before you can think about it the two of you are rolling in the grass, arms and legs tangled in each others clothing.

You come to a stop with Anakin over you, hair haloed against the clear blue sky.

Then Anakin makes a sound that could almost be called a squeek. He jerks back, head up. A shaak looks down at you, a bit of Anakin's hair in it's muzzle.

"You---" And Anakin is up, waving his hands at the creature, lecturing it as you flop back in the grass and laugh and laugh. 

Later when Anakin has run out of steem and the sun is a bit lower in the sky, you pack up your picknic and slowly make your way back to the house.

You roll your eyes and flop back in the grass dramaticly. "Alas I have been defeated. How will I ever be able to face my family after such a defeat." Then you twist your hips. Anakin lets go of a huff of breath, compleatly unprepaired for the move. 

You end up pressed against one of the shaaks, who look at you zero thoughts behind their eyes as they go on chewing at the grass. 

"Alright, alright, truse?" Anakin asks, levering himself up.

You nod, and together you head back towards your pickic before the shaak can destroy any more of it then they already have. Later when the sun is a bit lower in the sky, you pack up and slowly make your way back to the house.

For the second night in a row Anakin has nightmares. You wake when he rolls away from you, clutching at th eblanket and the mattress, he's mumbing almost words. The lamp on the bedside table shakes, the curtains flutter even though the window is closed. It's worse tonight.

"Anakin?" you ask because thats the only explanation your sleep addled brain can process. 

R2 beeps afirmative and swivels, speeding out the door. 

You stumble out of bed, catching the door frame before crossing the hall and pushing Anakin's door open. It's a mess. The curtains are whipping back and fourth, the bedside lamp is spinning an inch above it's place. picktures have been knocked off the walls. 

This is so much worse then last night.

"Padme..."

"You looked like you were having a nightmare." (if:$5tattoine)[You bite your lip. "Was it your mother again?"

He looks down at his hands tangled in the sheets, and nods.] "My mother had been captured. I can't tell where, but I know she's in pain, crying out for help."

"I'm so sorry." You lean into him, letting him feel that you're here for him. This is something you don't know how to handle. 

After a time he lets out a slow steady breath. "Thank you. I'll be fine now. You can go back to sleep if you want."

You shrug. You have been yawning but it's not like you need to be up early tomorrow. "In a bit." 

You drift off.

You grip his hands, going up on your tiptoes, and leaning in for a kiss. You can actually relax here. R2 is plugged into the security and no one can approach the house without tripping the alarms. There are nightengales and crickets softly singing outside. Anakin cups your face, lacing his fingers through the hair at the back of your neck. He leans in, tongue teasing your lip. You pull back to catch your breath. 

His eyes are dark, face flushed. "I can't believe. You're so amazing." He tilts his head a fraction and then gets caught by a yawn. You giggle before yawning yourself. 

"Maybe, just cuddles tonight?" 

He briefly looks disapointed, then his expression tips towards chagrin. "Yeah, it has been a a long trip."

You step back tugging his hand towards one of the bedrooms. You move around each other in expectant silence. You take turns in the bathroom before turning back the covers. He's so careful, slipping in behind you. He presses up agianst your back. You tug his arm around you. You're warm and cofortable, and there's a hint of potentiol simmering between you as you let your eyes close. 

You wake hours later, and stretch, only to brush your arm against another form. Anakin grumbles in his sleep, before his eyes flutter open. You feel him take a breath. Awe and something that might be love in his eyes.  His legs are tangled up with yours, your sleep gown twisted around you, as he presses you down into the matress and catches your lips.

You slip away after a moment, fighting back another yawn. "Good night," you say and retreat to your bedroom, closing the door behind you. You take a few minutes to put away a few of your things, brush out your hair and slip into the attached bathroom, for a proper watter shower, rinsing off the sweat and dust of the journey. 

turning back the light comforter, you slip under the sheets and relax to the sounds of home. 

You wake with the mourning sun drifting in through the window. Somewhere beyond the bedroom door Anakin is moving around, taking in a low voice you can't quite make out. R2 beeps in response and he laughs. 

All the danger and stress and burocracy and somehow you still managed to end up here. You stretch and slip out of bed to start the day.

You wake up with the mid-mourning sun slipping through the curtains. You can hear Anakin humming in the bathroom. Anakin seems to have set the fears of the night asside. 

The mourning is a lazy one but eventually you are faced with the question of how to fill the day.

You shake Anakin's shoulder, calling his name until the lamp falls back to the desk and the pictures still. Anakin looks around. He runs a hand over his face. R2 beeps a hestiant question.

"Should we go?" you ask in the softest voice you can manage. 

"Don't go." He takes a breath and opens his eyes "Your presence is soothing."

"Another nightmare?"

"Jedi don't have nightmares."

You glance around the room. The first hint of mourning is lightening the sky outside the window. The curtains are a little tattered, the picktures are crooked. It's nothing that couldn't be tidied up, but you saw his distress. 

"I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She is suffering, Padmé. They're killing her! She is in pain... I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I have to go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padmé. I don't have a choice." The words come spilling out of him in a flood of  emotion. 

Your instinctive reactin is to say that theres always a choice, but maybe not this time. Maybe thats part of being able to touch the force. He doesn't have a choice, but you do.

He blinks up at you, awe and surprise in his eyes. "What about Master Obi-wan?"

You smile, take his hand. "I guess we won't tell him, will we?"

It's a simple matter to pack your things and return to your shuttle. with your diplomatic clearence and Anakin piloting you slip past the outer orbit like a whisper. It's only a matter of hours before you see Tattooine through the viewport. 

Anakin lands in a cheep docking bay and slips the Rodian an extra few credits to make sure no one messes with the ship. He stops in the doorway, looking out at the city in a daze. You talked briefly during the flight. There are a few ways you could find Shmi, but Anakin seems to be at a loss. It seems to be up to you to choose what to tackle first.

You step back, folding your hands in front of you. 

"I understand. Do what you need to do. When your mother is safe you can come back. no one will ever know you were gone."

His expression breaks open, releaf mixing with the fear and determination. 

"I'll be back in two days. Nothing will happen."

You nod even with the bad feeling settling low in your gut. 

R2 bumps into your leg as you watch Anakin drive the speeder away down the hill. You pat his dome and turn, slowly making your way inside. 

Anakin doesn't return that day. 

He isn't there when you wake up the next mourning. You answer messages and try to reed and sit in the garden stairing out at the lake and the flowers and not seeing any of it. Another night and Anakin still hasn't returned, but there's still time. He likely doean't want to leave his mother after not seeing her for years. 

When the com comes, you jump off the couch in a mix of surprise, fear and anticipation. You rush to the coms station, and wave open the call before checking where or who it's coming from.

It's Obi-Wan, not Anakin. He's got his robe pulled tight around him, recording the message from in front of his shuttle. "Anakin, my long range transmitter has been knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant. I have tracked the bounty hunter Jango Fett to the droid foundries on Geonosis.  The Trade Federation is to take taking delivery of a droid army here and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray is behind the assassination attempts on
Senator Amidala. The Commerce Guilds and Corporate Alliance have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!... Wait!!" In the message Obi-Wan is attacked by droids. He reflects the first shot before the message goes dark.

Your hand comes up to cover your mouth, as you brace yourself. Obi-Wan could be dead. You have no knowledge of where Anakin is. Fear tries to swamp over you but you're far too used to it's presence by now.

"R2," your voice sounds odd. "Forward this message to the Jedi council. Use Anakin's codes if you have them. Then call ahead to the shuttleport. I'll need something small that still has hyperdrive capabuility, and I'll need you to fly it."

It spins it's dome and beeps.

"I'll be fine," you tell them. You're not sure if it's true but you have to keep going. The real question is where you'll end up.

You tilt your head back, blinking. "Well, good mourning."

His grin could belong to a cat. "Good mourning." 

You sit up, and he gives you a bit of space. 

"You know, we could just spend all day right here," Anakin goes on.

You shove one of the pilows at him. "Maybe if you wanted the council to come after us." You make a face. "And I have to set up the drop for anything that Dorme and Captain Typho might need to send me, and for that I require caff." You're tempted to snuggle back down and ignore the rest of the world, even if it is les then an hour's work.

Anakin hums, then leans in to kiss your shoulder. "Then I believe it's my duty to find you breakfast." He slips away, out of bed, grabbing his outer robe from the dresser and wrapping it around him over his boxers before slipping away towards the kitchen. 

Breakfast does sond good. You stretch, and turn towards the bathroom to put yourself together.

You relax into the bed, pulling hi down with you.
](else:)[
You slide your leg up his, rocking your hips into him. You can feel his cock thick against your hip."Oh force, Padme. I--" He props himself up, looking down at you. His hair is a mess and his eyes are dark and desperate. "I've never done this before."

You have, but you don't say that. "That's fine. You're doing good so far. Do you have?"

"Protection? Yeah. I've got a clip."

You nod. You have your own protection but it's good to hear. "Then just follow my lead and do what feels good." You spread your thighs and guide him until he's kneeling between them. He's looking at you like he wants everything and doesn't know what to touch first.

"Here," you say, guiding his hand down between your legs. The backs of his nails draw lines of sensation up the inside of your thigh. 

"A little higher." You tip your hips, clutching his shoulders. He finds your folds, running his fingers through them. You bite your lip, making an unholy sound. His touch is a little too rough, a little too hesitant, but it's still so good. 

"Almost," you gasp, looking down through your eyelashes."Your thumb, here," You spread your folds and guide his fingers to your clit. When he rolls it between his fingers, you catch your breath and arch your back as a rush of hot pleasure washes through you.

"Force," Anakin watches you transfixed. Pressing again, he grips your hips when you rock into the touch, scooting just a little closer, pressing his thighs up against yours. "Padme, can I?"

"Inside," you gasp, "Need you inside."

He shifts enough to push his boxers down and off, and you get your first look at his cock. If you're honest you don't have a lot to compare it to, but it certainly feels thick enough when he guides himself to your entrance. It's good. You rock your hips, taking him deeper. He rocks his hips, and nearly slips free, except you close your legs around him and hold him in place. 

You're both panting as you meet his eyes. This time you move together. Ripples of pleasure become waves, lifting you higher. Anakin mutters words in a few different languages, before saying, "Force, Padme." and coming inside you.

You're so close. You tangle your fingers with his, pressing your clit until you fall off the edge.

Some time later you notice the sun creeping in through the window. Anakin is playing with your hair. Hunger is creeping up on you and no matter how much you'd like to ignore it, the rest of the world does exist. 

You roll towards Anakin and ask, "Shower or caff?"

He strokes a hand down your arm. "You have a shower, I'll get the caff ready." He leans in and takes a kiss before roling out of bed, and grabbing his robe.

the Lake country could be pulled out of time, separate from the rest of the galaxy.

You have strawberries and sweet cakes, and Anakin makes both tea and caff. His hand finds yours every time he passes your seat, sending fluttering's of warmth across your skin.

After breakfast Anakin excuses himself to the garden, dancing with his light saber in slow patterns that are both deliberate and beautiful. You managed to tag yourself away from watching for long enough to send the few messages duty demands. Then, like letting out a breath the rest of the day is yours.

You look out across the garden down to the lake and the fields. Memories from childhood  drift past. The eagerness you had back then, the desperation to pack as much fun into every second as you could.

How do you want to spend your day?

A swim sounds perfect. You change into a swimming suit, wrap a sarong around your waist and folded towel over one arm. Anakin goes still, mouth slightly open and eyes dart as you step onto the porch.

"I'm going down to the lake. Join me?" You ask.

He nods, blinks, seems to draw himself together. Finally, he smiles. "Of course." It takes him a handful of minutes to get changed, and then you're both strolling down the gravel path towards the shore. 

This particular lake has been carefully cultivated, safe from any creatures of the deep core. The water is clear and shimmering as you approach. there's a small boathouse, and a floating dock stretching out onto the water. The wood has worn smooth and gray with age, but still quite serviceable. On another day you might take out a canoe, but today you want to feel the water on your skin. 

You leave your towel and sarong on the dock, slip off your sandals and easier way across the pebbles until you can dip your toe in the water.  It's cold enough that you shiver, hesitating for a moment before plunging forward. The water is just above your knees when you point your arms and dive forward.

Bubbles swirl around youand you follow them back to the surface. Rainbows and drops of water and fractal reflections dancing around you as you turn back to the shore.

Anakin is still standing there, hesitation written on his features. You move closer, tilt your head, feel the beads of water trace crooked lines down your skin.

"Anakin?"

"I, ah, was never a very good swimmer." He rubs at the back of his neck.

You pack a picknic and Anakin agrees to carry it on the way up to the falls. It's a wonderful view, three terraces pouring water from the lake out and down into a seeming endless pool. The fields below the falls aren't tended and small wildflowers grow up in patches, reaching for the sun. There's even a herd of shaak grazing in the distance. 

"I'd have never guessed this was here," andkin says, laying out the basket.

"My friends and I found it as a child. That was the summer I had my first crush." You glance at anakin and bite your lip when you see the aprasing look he's giving you."

"Who were they?" his tone is cassual, his look is anything but. 

"I don't know..." You draw your skirt under you and pat the ground, making sure not to sit on a wet spot.

"Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me." Anakin sits beside you, tipping his head back in a hauty way.

"Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?"

"They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded." This time he seems sincere.

You throw together a plate of cheeses, olives, and crackers and make your way out to the garden. Anakin is still practicing, but it seems less organized now. He twirles his saber, saluting you as you settle at a whitewashed wrought iron table in the shade of an old fruit tree. there's a book you've been meaning to read loaded onto your tablet.

You read, nibbling at the snacks and watching Anakin. It's a comfortable holding pattern. Part of you wishes the galaxy could stop turning and you could stay right here the rest of time. As soon as that thought drifts through your mind you shiver. You look up as a breeze tosses the branches above you. Anakin comes to a natural stop turning off his light saber. He's watching you.

"Do you ever feel like…" You're not sure how to put it into words.

Anakin hums. "Like there's something there, if you could only find a way to reach out and catch it?"

"Yes." You shake your head, trying to brush the thought away.

Anakin comes over to sit with you. He picks up a cracker, just holding it. "As a Jedi, they tell us to listen to the force, but sometimes I wonder..."

People outside the Jedi talk about the force in such poetic terms, It's hard to truly learn anything about it.you make an encouraging sound, hoping Anakin will go on.

"Using the force, and listening to the force, it feels like circular logic sometimes."

You make a low considering sound. You're not force sensitive, or at least, not enough to be a jedi. You have hunches and feelings as much as anyone, but it's never been something you studied, something that shaped your life. 

He sighs, letting his head fall back and tossing the cracker back onto the plate. "Sometimes I just wish the instructions were clear and streighforward." 

You nod, watching the layers of leaves against the sky.

You stroll through the garden and up towards the terrace overlooking the lake. It's shaded by a pair of old trees and the flowerpots are blooming. Anakin has stopped his practice to join you. When you ean against the stone railing you can't help remembering all the times you cane here when you were younger. Those were easier days, simpler days, when the weight of the whole galaxy wasn't hovering over you.

"When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water." You point out towards a point of rock 100 yards offshore.

"I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet." There's something about his tone, you can't quite place it but you get the feeling he's talking about something else. He's looking at you. His touch is light, trailing fingers over your back. 

You glance away, "...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing."

"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything's soft... and smooth..." 

The way he's looking at you, it's all encompasing, almost overwhelming. You could drown in that look.

You manage to clear your throat and glance back at the island in the lake. "There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces."

"Everything here is magical." 

He means you. It makes something in your chest flutter.

"You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn't." You hardy know what you're saying anymore, just sensless words adding to the sounds of the lake and the trees.

"Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real." He reaches up and strokes a strand of hair away from your face. He looks at you and a smile slowly rises on his face.

He hesitates for a minute. You hold out a hand. At last his shouders come down and he drops his robe on the dock next to your things. 

Anakin enters the water slowly, letting his body aclimate to the temprature one step at a time. When he's knee deep, you come up to him.

"You don't have to swim." You say. "The boathouse should be unlocked. If you look around in there, you should be able to find some lounge chairs. I'll probably want to subathe when I'm done."

He nods and heads for the boat house, leaving you to tip back in the water and let your hair float out around you. Growing up you went swiming often, but it's been a while. It's nice, if a touch cold. 

You do a few laps of the dock, and float in circles, watching the clouds for a bit. After maybe twenty minutes you pull yoursef out of the water. Anakin has two lounge chairs set up on the shore, the towels draped over the spare. He waves as you come over.

"Have fun?"

"Loads. Pass me that hair brush?"

Anakin unfolds your sorry and finds the brush and ties you left there.

"I love having long hair but i swear if I don't brush it out while it's wet it'll be a mass of tangles by dinner."

"And I thought I had it bad with the one small braid." He picks up the brush then hesitates. "Would you like help?"

"You don't have to." You pull your wet hair over one shoulder wringing out the water. 

"I want to." 

You hesitate, but when he guestures for you to turn around you do. He starts at the bottom, slowly working his way up to your scalp, patting your hair dry with the towel he didn't use. After the first few minutes you relax, leaning into his strokes.

"Orders?" he asks.

You nod. "Orders like get on your knees, or open your mouth, or take off your robe." you stand and step forward, making a show out of looking him over.

"Good," you purr. "Then go inside, take off your cloak and wait for me by the bed."

He nods. For a moment he sways forward, then he turns sharply and slips inside. 

You take a few minutes gathering up your things. Letting the anticipation grow, before following him. 
(if: $sfw is false)[
You pause in the doorway. 

Anakin has stripped off his his outer robe leaving him in only his undershirt and legings. He's sitting on the end of the bed, leaning forwards slightly. Even with the ange you can see the hint of anticipation between his legs. 

He starts to stand, but when you hold up a hand he freezes. "Before we start. If you say stop, I will. No questions asked. If you're not sure about something you are alowed to ask for clerification. Is there anything you know you don't like?"

He shakes his head the hint of a cocky smile rising on his features. "I don't think I could dislike anything when it comes to you."

"We'll see," you step forward, every inch the queen. "Kneel, there on the floor, hands behind your back."

Everything he does is unnaturly graceful, and this is no exception. He slips off the bed, sitting on his heels without a his of hesitation or discomfort. Stepping forward, you run your fingers through his hair, finding the small tail at the back. A short tug at the band has it falling free. You take your time with it, waiting until he's relaxed to move forward. 

"I'm going to use your mouth. You will not touch yourself until I say. Do you understand?"

He swalows, nods, starts to speak, then hesitates.

"Speak." You make it a command as much as a request.

"Can I touch you?" The quetion spills out, and you take a moment to consider.

"My legs." you agree. "Nothing else unless I say."

His breathing has quickened and he's biting his lip as he nods. 

You step back, slowly and deliberatly removing your clothing. It's not nearly as elaborate as it can sometimes be, but it's enough that Anakin lets out a little needy sound, still watching from his spot on the floor

A shiver runs over your skin when you set the last piece aside. Barely glancing at Anakin, you turnto the bed and arrange the pillows to your satisfaction. When you're leaning back against them, legs spread at the edge of the bed you finally fix your gaze on your lover.

"Come here." 

He rocks forwards, doing a shuffling knee walk rather then standing. He glances at your face before resting his hands on your thighs. 

You stroke a hand through his hair again. "Good boy. Now open your mouth." When he obeys you scoot forward that last inch towards the edge of the bed. His mouth is warm and wet. It takes hims a moment and a few short commands to encorage him to cover his teeth and use his tongue. Then he finds your clit and sucks. You moan, rocking into him, gripping his hair to keep him where you want him.

When he squeezes your thigh, you let him up enough the breathe. 

"Please," he gasps, "Please." your slick is all over his mouth. He seems almost drunk with it.

"More. You can touch yourself when you've made me come."

He leans in, and works with abandon, desperation pushing him to draw out every sound you can make until your core lets go and you fall back onto the pillows. You turn your head enough to see Anakin rocking in place, hand hovering over the buldge in his tights.

"Do it," you say, and that's all he needs to push them down, get his cock out and go to town, eyes on you the whole time.

He nods, slumping in his seat. "Most of the time I think I know, but then some Jedi master chews me out for not understanding something. It's so frustrating. I know I coud do so much if I just..."

"If all the idiots would get out of the way?" Your voice is wry, humor tinging your words, but there's real emotion under it. 

"Yes," He throws his hands up. "I can't tell you the number of times me and Obi-Wan have been sent to a planet - people who have requested Jedi mediation - only to learn they expect, even order us, to rubber stamp whatever it is."

You lean forward, getting into it. "It took two years to get the Gungon cities offichally recognised. We'd just had a whole peace thing and then half the regonal delegates spent months arguing about where to draw the border lines. It's a swamp. It's not like any human is going to go build a house out there. It's already protected land. No one is going to profit off another 60 feet. Get off your high horse and stop arguing just because you like hearing your own voice!"

Anankin matches your energy. "Oh you say you care about proper safety protocal? Is that because someone died in your mining opperation and the media found out about it? Would you have even acnoledged that that site existed if it didn't hit the net during an election year?"

"Oh don't get me started on election years." You pick up a bit of cheese and use it to point at him. "Oh that promice you made two years ago and forgot about? Yeah, I'm not the one holding up that project. Did you even start the paperwork? No I don't have any extra staff you can use and then shove the blaim off on."

Anakin lets out a short bark of a laugh, before puffing himself up and speaking in a lowoverly pretentious voice. "Don't you know who I am? I'm the most important flibbit of gibbit. How dare you insult me by saying I actually did something. I never get off my ass. I'll have you thrown out, and then arrested and then strung up by your ankles so everyone can see your underwear."

You lean over the table not bothering to hold in the laughter. Any hint of a bad feeling has been whiped away. When you look up at Anakin again, you know this is exactly where you want to be.

"You can't be the only Jedi with that problem. Is there someone youu can talk to?"

Anakin nods, putting together a collection of crackers and cheese. "Sure. Any of the masters in theory, but each of the linieges have their own traditions. I'm expected to go to Obi-Wan first, or maybe Master Yoda. He's my great great grandmaster or something but everyone else is either dead or... well Dooku."

"I didn't realize he was..."

Anakin nods. "When he left the order Obi-Wan closed off for a while. It wasn't easy. But I never really met him. It happened maybe six months after I joined the order and I was still swamped with make-up work."

You consider how to phrase your next question. "Here on Naboo there are a few different schools of Philosophy, and that's not even getting into the larger universe. I always through that if one way doesn't work for you, then find something that does. But the Jedi aren't like that?"

"Sometimes they are." Anakin tilts his head back and forth chewing for a minute. "If you look at our histories, there were dozens of examples of people who didn't agree with the teachings of the main temple, so they went off and founded their own. Or people who went our to teach about the force and then things changed and they were out there doing their own thing. That's why there are so many old temples scattered over the galaxy. Except then some of them fell to the dark and others grew into the sages or the whills. These days the senate needs so much help, and there are fewer and fewer of us... I get the impression that there just isn't enough time to sit down and look at how ans why the force works."

"That's a real shame," you say. 

Anakin nods, then shrugs. "I don't think sitting around and contemplating the universe would work for me anyway. I'd much rather be acting."

You consider that, then nod. "Niether of us are the type of person to sit around."

"And yet here we are," He says and the smile is back.

You dramatically swoon in your chair. "Oh dear, whatever will I do?"

He laughs, and it's infectious. soon you're both gasping for air. You start to wind down, then catch each others eye and start laughing all over again. 

It feels good. 

Later when the snacks have all been eaten and the evening is drawing in, you loop your arm through his and wander back inside. Despite your assertion you are so, so glad to spend this time with him. 

[[evening->9-8-1]]

(if:$ch9day is 1)[Dinner is a lazy affair. You and Anakin circle each other in the kitchen, reheating packages of whatever looks good in the moment. You slump on a couch to catch a short vid before the evening catches up with you and it's time to retreat to your rooms.

You send a few short messages letting your family and team know nothing has changed, and answer a few questions. It doesn't take along and soon you join Anakin in the kitchen, watching as he makes pasta.

When the sun has set and you've both started yawning Anakin nods to the bedroom.

You take his hands, lace your fingers through his and lean up to kiss him. It tastes like sunshine, like the lake water on your lips. He leans in, and with a few little tugs and touches, the two of your are sitting in the water. 
 (set:$anakin to it+1)(if:$show is true)[

He leans back, the water lapping at his chest. You could take this further, it's not like there's anyone around to see, or you could just sit and talk with him. In this moment there's no rush, no ticking clock, just the two of you and this moment.

:: 9-9-2 [Anakin] {"position":"9575,1800","size":"100,100"}
You grin like a fox, cup your hands together and squirt a streem of water at him. It's barely anything, just a little splash across his shouder but his mouth falls open, and he looks at you with wide surprise on his face. 

"What?"

You splash him again, giggling.

"Oh no you don't." He shoves some water back in your direction. You turn your shoulder laughing before retaliating. 

It only takes a minute before you're splashing and throwing water at each other like teenagers. 

You catch the look in his eye a moment before he uses the force to lift up a wall of water and send it at you in a wave. You have enough time to cry out before you're swamped, knocked off your feet and swept under. 

You come up soaked and sputtering. Anakin has his hands on his hips, head tipped back. "Give up?"
 (set:$anakin to it+1)(if:$show is true)[

You briefly consider sneeking up on him and tugging his ankles out from under him, but he was worried about swimming earlier. You pick yourself up, raising your hands.

"Reluctant as I am I must admit surender. I am bested."

"I accept your surrender." He offers a hand. You take it. You're both dripping and your skin is pleasently cool in the sun.

"You know I think there are lounge chairs in the boat house."

He glances in that direction and nods. Together you move towards the shore, setting out chairs and relaxing until the sun is lower in the sky. When you start to shiver, you wrap yourself in a towel and make your way back up to the house. 

[[evening ->9-8-1]]


:: 9-9-3 {"position":"9325,1800","size":"100,100"}
You take his hand, and lead him into the water. With gentle touches you encorage him to lean back in the water and float. You hold his head, smiling down at him.

"Thank you for being here with me. For trusting me."

He smiles. "I'll always trust you."

You look away. "You say that so easilly. I wish I had your confidence."

He lifts one hand out of the water, gently holding onto you. "You've faced down the whole of the senate."

"Yes, well, stubornness can go a long way." 

He laughs, and shifts back to his feet. "Well, any time you need a confidence boost, just come to me. I'll always be willing to tell you how amazing you are." 

You squeeze his hand before bringing the conversation back to what you were doing. "Do you know brest stroke? I find it's easy for beguinners to learn."

You spend some time swiming together before wandering up onto the shore. There are lounge chairs in the boat house, and you sit in the sun until hunger draws you both up to the house.

Then you are being swept into the office. Chancelor Palpatine stands, as do the Jedi. You recognise several of their faces. Mace Windu and Master Yoda are both on the Jedi Council. The others... It takes you a moment to place them, other members of the council: Plo Koon, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Luminara Unduli. For so many high ranking Jedi to be in the same room. Someone is taking things seriously. 

Master Yoda is the first to approach you. You only met him the once, when he came to Qui-Gon's funeral, and you only spoke to him briefly. Still the sincarity he offers seems real. 

"Padmé, your tragedy on the landing platform, terrible. With you the force is strong... young Senator. Seeing you alive brings warm feeling to my heart."

More sympathies. Grief swells in your chest, but you do not let it touch your face. "Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?" 

Mace Windu stepps forward. "Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo."

It's far too early for him to be certain of that. You fucus on him, and he meets your eyes. There's something there. Something in the air, like the whole room is holding its breath. 

You consider what to say.

Jar Jar arrives before the Jedi. He welcomes you and jabbers on about how different the Senate is compared to Naboo, the people back home, the messes he's gotten himself into and out of. Another bit of tension lets go and drifts away. It helps. You feel mostly yourself again as the lift sounds alerting you that Master Kenobi has arrived.

Master Kenobi has a plaque thanking him in the palace, and the brief occupation is already being taught in schools. A part of you finds it hard to believe that it's been a decade. Then the Jedi are standing in front of you.

Obi-Wan Kenobi looks diferent from how you remember him. It's the same robes, the same blue eyes, but his hair is swept back from his face, a neat beard covering his chin. He's settled into himself. No more the headstrong padawan she last met. Now the man that stands before her knows who he is and what he is capable of.

He takes your hand. His grip if firm without being fierce. "It's a pleasure to see you again, M'Lady."

Your smile is as natural as the day. "It has been far too long master Kenobi." You turn to great the other Jedi. No one had mentioned a second knight but... Then his eyes meet yours.

Short hair, apart from the Padawan braid. It's darker then before, no longer bleached by years under a double star system. Still a little awkward. Passion still bleading through his features with every expression.

"Ani? My goodness-- You've grown." It's a stupid thing to say, you wish you could take the words back as soon as they're out. But really, could anyoe be expected to make sense whith their thoughts in such a jumble?

"So have you, grown more beautiful I mean." He stumbles over his words. It's stupidly cute, like a puppy that hasn't grown into it's paws. 

You toss out the first thing that comes to mind.

(t8n: "slide-up")+ (transition-time: 5s)[There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic.

This Separatist movement, under the leadership of the mysterious Count Dooku, has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy.

Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to the Galactic Senate to vote on the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC to assist the overwhelmed Jedi....

You land with a faint jolt and flip the switch for R2 to deploy. You are a pilot in this moment. No one would recognize you under the flight helmet. That's the point of course. No one can know that Padme Amidala - former Queen turned Senator, is not the one waiting for the ramp to lower on the cruiser. 

"We made it. I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all." your captain says as he exits his own escort ship. He looks relieved but you can't help but feel that your ordeal is just starting.
(set:$typho to it+1)(if:$show is true)[`
{Captain Typho approves}
`]
You stand ready to fall in behind Senator Amidala as she steps down onto the platform. The explosion knocks you off your feet. You're still wearing the flight helmet. You feel it press against the back of your scull, Padded leathers protecting your arms. Even so, the world spins and for a moment you aren't sure where you are- which way is up. 

You've been trained for this. Assassination attempts are not a new concept. It only takes a few seconds for you to be back on your feet. The sight before you stuns you worse then the fall.
(set:$danger to 1)

The ship is listing to one side, dark smoke and guttering flame still escaping, as it threatens to fall off the platform. The guards, and escort have been tossed aside like rag dolls. Some of them are gasping. Some of them are crying out. Some of them are all too silent. Corde, in full regalia, is lying in the center of the explosion. Her dress is smoldering, a hint of flame catching against her leg. Neither Corde now you give it any head as you run to her and kneel at her side. 

"I'm sorry, my lady..." Corde sighs, before her head falls to the side. 

She has nothing to apologize for. Captain Typho is tugging at your arm. He's saying there's still danger. You can't blame the explosion for the ringing in your ears. Corde is dead. She woud still be alive if you hadn't returned to this planet. 

Grief and guilt threaten to overwhelm you as Captain Typho pulls you away. He speaks to the remaining guards, the the pilots, R2 is there by your side. It bumps against your leg, whistling a question. 

For some reason that breaks through the static. You have to think. You have to plan. 

What are you going to do next?

You nod and somethin in you relaxes a fraction. "You as well. I know the next few weeks are going to be terribly busy, but I do want to hear about how Breha's doing." You have the urge to run your fingers through your hair but it's tied back so you can't.

Bail glances at the room before guiding you to the side with one arm on your shouder. The Jedi take their chance to leave, as Bail speaks in a low tone.

"You should be aware that Orn Free Taa tried to call for a vote this afternoon. The Senate had just been informed of the explosion. We didn't know you'd survived. Even with your survival it will be hard to talk everyone down at this rate."

You close your eyes for a moment, and nod. "Thank you for telling me."

He nods. "Contact me later. There are a few allies I want to introduce you to. We have our work cut our for us." <!--Hook for Mon Mothma-->

He steps back and you share a look before he turns away.

You stand as the group moves towards the door. Captain Typho and Dorme are the only ones who seem to realize what you are waiting for. They linger as The Chancellor tilts his head and studies you. 

"Padme?" he asks in a quiet tone.

You don't bite your lip, that would be a sigh of weakness. Still, there's something in your voice as you speak. "Shive, in all honesty how close are we to war?"

His expression shifts. A small smile touches his lips, without reaching his eyes. Stepping forward he takes you hand.

"Padme, I know things look grim now, but you must trust me." <!--Hook for Dark Leia-->

Your vision swims and he helps to steady you. 

"Now really, have you even let a healer look at you since the attack? Come, take her home. We can talk in the coming days." He waves to Dorme and the Captain, who fuss at you until you're down the hall, and headed for the speeder.

"Quite the ordeal?" He lifts an eyebrow and dips his head. "There has been no offense. I understand that you lost more then just a bodyguard, but a friend."

You nod, It's hard to believe. Just this morning you were talking to her, planning... "Corde has been with me since just before I was elected Queen." There's a quiver in your voice. Master Windu shifts to the side. You realize that he's put himself between you and the rest of the group, shielding you from them. You don't really know him, can't tell if it's deliberate, but it gives you the chance to take a breath and fit the steel back into your spine.

"Thank you for your assistance." It feels too flat, too formal, but in the current setting..."

Of course, please do not hesitate to contact the Jedi if you need anything." He bows, and steps back, his attention turning towards the other Jedi.

Dorme pushes into your private office with her arms full of a white box hat smells heavely. She clears a patch of flimsywork, puts down her offerings and pulls up a chair. Opening the box reveals fruit pastries, and caraf of caff. You reach for the latter before she's done laying things out. The events of the night have not helped the hyperspace lag that you're fighting. You've been in your office at 500 republica for a terribly short time and yet there seem to be a million things that need your attention urgently. 

Obi-Wan and Anakin have gone to report to the Jedi council. Captain Typho is not pleased with you and has stationed himself in the outer office so that any time you venture past your door you have to face his glare. Bail is busy with his own planetary matters. 

Dorme adds a bit of honey surup to your caff, before finally passing it over.

"You are my only friend," You say as you hold the mug close. She rolls her eyes, but she's smiling as she pours her own cup and settles down catty corner from you. You focus on your caff as she pulls up a tablet and looks things over.

"The local attendants have handled most of the day to day matters, but there are a few things that you need to address personally. The full senate won't meet for another 9 days, barring an emergency call. Your commitee duties need to be addressed though. There's a new case from Ryloth for the anti-slavery commitee that needs to be reviewed, and your vote tallied.

You wake to an alarm, R2s shrill screech and the whoosh of a pair of blast doors closing in the other room. Sitting up you blink and realize the light has changed. You can't see the traffic through the window. It's gone opaque, red emergency lights flickering to life around the doorways. 

R2 has an electroprod out, pointing back towards the door and the assumed threat. It's camera spun from you to the door and back.

"What's happening?" You snatch up your com, and grab the dressing gown laid out for you, wrapping it around your nightdress. 

You flinch, falling into a crouch when the door swings open, then the stripes of blue light register and you realize Anakin and Obi-Wan are beconing you forward. 

"Padme, come with us."

You grab Anakin's outstretched hand. He takes the lead, Obi-Wan a step behind you aas you cross the hall, slipping into another set of rooms. You don't know the building, don't know where they're taking you, but you can taste the tang of recycled air and bare static makes the hair on your arms stand on end. 

"What?" You manage to gasp when you finally come to a stop. There's a blast door between you and whatever might be chasing. R2 has managed to keep up. He's plugged into a wall port. Anakin looks like he wants to help, but he doesn't seem to want to let go of your hand. Obi-Wan breathes out slowly and turns off his lightsaber. He closes his eyes and tilts his head back as if feeling a breaze on his face.

"We should be safe here," Obi-Wan says.

"And where is here exactly?" You ask.

"A saferoom," Anakin answers. "All the buildings housing senetorial staff are required to have them. It means they know where we are..." He trailed off looking at his master. 

"It also means that the rest of the security will be rallying around us. We recognised the threat early. Now we just have to wait." Obi-Wan meets Anakin's eyes and it's Anakin who looks away first. 

"What threat?" Your voice is strained. Years of political experience lets you keep an even tone no mater how much you want to screem.

Both jedi turn to you. Anakin is still holding your hand. Obi-Wan puts a hand on your shoulder. 

"There was another attack," Obi-Wan says. 

You suspected as much. You slump into one of the genaric armchairs. The room is only sparcely firnished, but it has that much comfort at least. 

"A breach was discovered in the air-recycler. There's no sign of gas, so we're assuming it's either a probe-droid or a biological threat. These safe rooms have seperate systems so either way it will not be able to reach us here."

"And Captain Typho? Dorme?"

"The Captain is organizing the search. Dorme insisted on joining him."

You sag a little. It happened too sudenly for the fear to truely settle in before. Now you start to feel traped. A part of you wishes that you'd done something sooner. Anakin and Obi-Wan are here. You could try to sleep, but...

Your eyes drift to R2. It's disconected from the wall and has put away it's electro-prod. 

"R2, do you have com access?" These rooms are sometimes shielded, but R2 beeps affirmative. Maybe you could still do something...

You are woken by a flash of blue and R2's beeping. A gasping cry escapes you as you startle. Anakin stands over you lightsaber ignighted. A flash from the window, and Obi-Wan was moving, across the room and breaking through the glass.

"Stay here," Anakin said, then he was out the door. Sabe and Captain Typho crossed his path.

"Padme? Why didn't you switch with me? Are you alright?" Dorme traced her hands down your arms. Your heart is hammering. Are you injured? No. They got here in time. 

"I'm alright." You take a breath and say it again. "I'm alright."

The reality of what happened settles over you. The trap worked. They were funneled right to you which means...

"R2?"

R2 beeps and spins coming forward to plug into the access port by the bedside table. You push Dorme away just far enough to turn and pull up the video R2 ques up. Dorme leans over your shoulder watching with you. 

A ledge on a nearby building, caught on an exterior camera. A figure with armor and a helmet. Not a togruta or a natolouan; human or something very close to it. 

You watch through them launching the drone, then go back to find the clearest shot. 

"R2 can you cross refrence?"

The little droid was already beeping. A moment later it flipped open several windows. Zam Wesell, a Clawdite, A bounty hunters guild licence, docking fees, a data trail in the local network. It wasn't enough to pin down where they were now, or who had hired them. On the other hand they hadn't done much to cover their tracks. If you had to guess you'd say they were counting on getting in and out too fast for anything to traced back.

You lean back and process the information. They could be across the sector by now, or Obi-Wan could have already caught them...
